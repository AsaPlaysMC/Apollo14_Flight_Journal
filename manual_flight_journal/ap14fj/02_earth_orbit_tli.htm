<div class="onboard"><b>000:43:56 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay. I'll get them. We're probably going to be collecting
those patches the rest of the flight.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>000:44:02 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes, they're going to be hiding everywhere.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>000:44:07 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay, Ed-babe. How about a temporary stowage bag?</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>000:44:11 Mitchell (onboard):</b> All right. I'll take one.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>000:46:15 Roosa (onboard):</b> Let's see. You might get out your bracket for the camera, if you're out of things to do, Al, and I'll be handling the camera, shortly.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>000:46:44 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes. We got to treat this with a little care because it might just come out of there like everything else does.</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control Houston. During this
lull in communications we'll start again to pass along those
heart rates at liftoff. That was a peak rate of 132 on command
module pilot Stu Roosa. He averaged in the 120's during
the boost phase of flight. In the case of Ed Mitchell his
peak rate was 90 and ran in the 80's. Commander Alan Shepard
we received no data on. We suspect a loose sensor or connector
and this will be fixed sometime in orbit during the more
quiet period. We presently show Apollo 14 in an orbit of
104 nautical miles [193 km] by 101 nautical miles [187 km]. We're at 54 minutes

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 2 hours,
4 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 14. We presently
show 14 in an orbit of 106.2 nautical miles [196.7 km] by 102.4 nautical
miles [189.6 km]. Our latest update on the translunar injection
burn shows a time of ignition of 2 hours, 28 minutes, 30 seconds,
a Delta-V of 10,366.5 feet per second [3,159.7 m/s], burn duration
of 5 minutes, 52 seconds, predicted velocity at time of
shutdown 35,551.8 feet per second [10,836.2 m/s], and altitude at time of
cutoff of 173 nautical miles [320 km]. The Go No/Go callup for <a href="acron.htm#tli"><font color=#206020>TLI</font></a>
will be made after acquisition at Carnarvon, although we
will have voice communications with Apollo 14 through <a href="acron.htm#aria"><font color=#206020>ARIA</font></a>
we will lose station acquisition in about 2 minutes into the
burn and will not be able to read onboard data. However,
the crew of Apollo 14 will pass a burn status report at the
end of burn and what they will be reading will be from their
<a href="acron.htm#dsky"><font color=#206020>DSKY</font></a>. They will pass along the velocity at time of shutdown,
altitude at time of shutdown, and H dot or altitude change
at time of shutdown. The translunar injection burn will be
done along the local horizontal. We're at 2 hours, 6 minutes
into the flight of Apollo 14 and we'll stand by until we
acquire the spacecraft. This is Apollo Control, Houston.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:07:00 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes, I'm going to go back - and make sure we haven't missed a single thing.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:07:06 Roosa (onboard):</b> I got the <a href="acron.htm#gn"><font color=#602020>G&N</font></a> Dictionary down here. All out, ready to read.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:07:13 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Let's just be sure we haven't missed anything on the checklist.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:07:22 Roosa (onboard):</b> Did they get us shafted on the [Garbled] on that <a href="acron.htm#los"><font color=#602020>LOS</font></a>?</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:07:41 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes. Yes, 10. And we're making 4 degrees a minute. So, it should change our <a href="acron.htm#aos"><font color=#602020>AOS</font></a> time - I mean our sunrise time to 2 and a half minutes [Garbled.]</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:07:53 Roosa (onboard):</b> [Garbled.]</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:07:54 Shepard (onboard):</b> And it should be earlier. Sunset should be earlier and sunrise should be earlier. Well, what does that work out for sunrise?</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:08:05 Roosa (onboard):</b> 02:19.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:08:13 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay. [Garbled] looking at our fuel pressure - I mean,

<div class="onboard"><b>002:09:56 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes, I'm glad you called that, Ed. It shows you what you can do. I had apparently knocked that thing to 24 frames per second.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:10:48 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes, I'm going to try to. You mean with the Hasselblad or what?</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:10:51 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes, the Hasselblad.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:10:52 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes, with the Hasselblad. We're supposed to do it only, you know, provided it locks anomalous to us, but I think we ought to just go ahead and take a few pictures ...</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:11:00 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes, I think we ought to ...</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:11:01 Roosa (onboard):</b> Oh, yes. I think we ought to take a couple as we come off. And then, when we roll and it comes in the hatch window, I think you ought to take a couple out of the hatch window.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:11:11 Shepard (onboard):</b> Have you got a range sight on the camera?</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:11:13 Mitchell (onboard):</b> No, not right now. Wouldn't hurt if we did, but we don't.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:11:41 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay. Time base 6 for a start, and then, we'll have sunrise. And then, we'll do all those good things,</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:11:49 Roosa (onboard):</b> Then we'll get <a href="acron.htm#aos"><font color=#602020>AOS</font></a> from Carnarvon. We'll get a Go for <a href="acron.htm#tli"><font color=#602020>TLI</font></a>, and we'll burn the son of a gun.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:12:14 Roosa (onboard):</b> Some ride.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:12:16 Roosa (onboard):</b> There was no doubt in your mind of lift-off, I was a little surprised at the level of the vibration prior to lift-off though. I'd been led to believe it was probably worse. Maybe they're strapping us in tighter nowadays.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:12:32 Shepard (onboard):</b> I didn't have any trouble with communications or anything.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:12:35 Roosa (onboard):</b> Oh, it was beautiful all the way. Boy, that BPC goes, doesn't it? That tower, son of a bitch moves out. I didn't even notice the switches being hard (laughter). I didn't figure I would.</div>

right on the mark. Played her right like the Sim. [Garbled] just like the simulator.</div>

guess I'd better pull that dark slide out right now. Right there.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:13:23 Roosa (onboard):</b> [Garbled] yet.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:13:27 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes, but I don't want to - be ready to take a picture and
miss a picture because of it.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:13:32 Shepard (onboard):</b> Anybody want any water?</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:13:34 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes. I'll take a slug of water.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:13:41 Shepard (onboard):</b> [Garbled] a good place to leave that baby [Garbled.]</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:14:38 Shepard (onboard):</b> I tell you, this weightlessness is really great, isn't it?</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:14:41 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes, I'll enjoy it.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>002:15:03 Roosa (onboard):</b> Your face doesn't look puffed up to me, particularly,</div>
