David Woods and Ronald Hansen.All rights reserved.</h5>Last updated September 21, 2003<h3>The mission</h3>Although Apollo 14 achieved only the third successful landing on the Moon, it was already the sixthsuccessful flight to the Moon.NASA had made flying to the Moon look easy, almost routine.Even the near disaster of Apollo 13 just 9 months previously had been handled so wellthat it only served to further convince people that NASA had everything under control.For the general public, flying to the Moon had become routine, almost boring.However, as the readers of this journal know, there was nothing routine about flying to the Moon,especially for the astronauts doing the flying.<p>Apollo 14 was scheduled to be the last of the "engineering" flights, designed to further check outthe complex equipment and procedures needed to land on the Moon.It was essential that the flight go well to clear the way for the more demanding,more exploration oriented flights to come.<h3>About the journal</h3>Shortly after the flight of Apollo 14, NASA prepared a series of transcripts which meticulously documented what was said by the astronauts and some of the ground support people during the flight.The following is an annotated combination of the transcripts which provide the reader with avery detailed look at the flight of Apollo 14.The bulk of the journal comes from the transcript of the radio traffic between the astronautsand Mission Control Center.Here you see NASA at its professional best, working through the mission and any problems that arise.These entries all start with the<a href="acron.html#get">GET</a>, or time since the start of the mission, in hours, minutes and seconds,at which the text was spoken.This is followed by the name of the speaker, usually one of the astronauts or the current<a href="info.html#capcom">Capcom</a>.This is followed by the text that was spoken, complete with the misspeaks, pauses, and other extrasthat make up human speech.The following is a list of the major speakers:<p><table border=0 cellspacing =10><tr><td align=center colspan=2><b>The astronauts</b></td></tr><tr><td>Mission commander</td>      <td>Alan B.

However, it also provides a look atwhat the astronauts were saying when they were free from the rigors of radio discipline.Surprisingly often they show themselves to be almost overwhelmed by the beauty of what theywere seeing or thrilled at actually being on the way to the Moon.At other times, the enormous demands of trying to do a very complicated jobas coolly and professionally as possible got to be too much for them.They needed to fly a nominal mission to show that NASA had recovered from thenear disaster of Apollo 13 and was ready for more advanced missions.Any serious error on their part or major technical problem would not only endanger theirmission, their lives, but also the rest of the Moon program.It is quite understandable that they would occasionally  respond in a very human manner.For the astronauts, there was never anything "routine" about flying to the Moon.<br>&nbsp;&nbspLike the radio traffic, the onboard text includes a GET and the name of the speaker.To set it apart from the radio traffic, it is colored <font color=#700000>dark red</font> and contains<font color=#700000>(onboard)</font> after the speaker.<p>A large amount of annotation has also been added to make the transcripts easier to understand,to provide some addition, hopefully interesting information, and to simply provide an outletfor at least some of the vast amount of Apollo trivia that we have collected over the years.These annotations are colored <font color=#000070>dark blue</font>.<h3>The making of this journal</h3>This is a work in progress, aiming to provide interested readers with an in depth lookat the flight of Apollo 14.  Feedback from readers is desired.Although great care was taken in preparing this journal, we have probably committed a fair number of errors.Even the original transcripts, meticulously prepared by paid professionals, contained some errors.Many of these errors were only revealed when we attempted to merge the various transcripts into one document. We only attempted to correct errors that probably occurred in the original transcription process.Other than this, no changes were made to the original text.For interested readers, the original documents are available as PDF files at several web sites including:<p><a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/mission_transcripts.htm>">http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/mission_transcripts.htm</a><p><hr><center><table cellpadding=8 width="80"><tr><td align=center><a href="index.html"><img src="pics/ind.gif" width="62" height="34" alt="Index"></a></td><td align=center><a href="A14_day01a.html"><img src="pics/next.gif" width="62" height="34" alt="Next"></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center><a href="index.html">Journal Home Page</a></td><td align=center><a href="A14_day01a.html">Day 1:</a></td></tr></table></center></body></html>
