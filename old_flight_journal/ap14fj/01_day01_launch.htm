<blockquote>
[January 31, 1971: first day of mission.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[The mid afternoon launch of Apollo 14 avoids the cool morning air of a
Florida winter. A cold front stretches across northern Florida with scattered rain showers to the south. This shower activity is intensifying and moving slowly towards the cape.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[Apollo 14 will be starting today from Pad A at Launch Complex 39 at the Kennedy Space Center. This complex was built with 2 fully operational launch pads; in the expectation of a much higher launch rate than was ever achieved. Only Apollo 10 departed from Pad B at a particularly busy time in the Apollo program, leading up to the launch of Apollo 11. Every other Apollo/Saturn V launch, including Apollo 14, began from Pad A.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[Like Apollo 12 and Apollo 13 before it, Apollo 14 is an
<a href="info.html#missions">'H' mission</a>,
designed to land at a precise site on the Moon and carry out local exploration.
Although originally targeted for Littrow Crater, it now has the job of finishing the
Apollo 13 mission and will land at Fra Mauro on the edge of the Imbrium Basin.
The landing sites for Apollo 11 and 12 had both been chosen to make the approach and landing
as safe and easy as possible.
However, Apollo 12s successful precision landing allowed the next landing site to be chosen
among the low, rounded hills of Fra Mauro.
A successful Apollo 14 mission would show that NASA had learned its lessons from Apollo 13 and
pave the way for the more exploration oriented missions to come.
However, Apollo 13s misfortunes had already led to the cancellation of Apollo 18 and 19.
Anything less than a nominal Apollo 14 mission would put the rest of the Apollo program in danger.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[The spacecraft/vehicle stack is designated AS-509, signifying that it is the ninth launch of the
Apollo/Saturn V combination. As the Apollo spacecraft components come off the production line,
they are also assigned serial numbers. Each had modifications which 
built on the experience gained from previous missions or which came from requirements of their
particular mission.
<p>
Both the Saturn V launch vehicle, SA-509, and the Lunar Module, <a href="acron.htm#lm"><font color=#202060>LM</font></a>-8, received several small
improvements.
However, as the result of Apollo 13, the
Command and Service Module, <a href="acron.htm#csm"><font color=#202060>CSM</font></a> 110, gained numerous <a href="info.html#csmupdates">
improvements</a> to both prevent similar problems and to help the crew to better
deal with any possible future inflight emergencies.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[The timing of an Apollo launch to the Moon falls within certain 'windows' or periods of time which
are influenced by daily and monthly factors. The daily restriction to the window is due to the
rotation of the Earth bringing the launch site to the correct relationship with the Moon's
position in its orbit, to allow enough of a parking orbit around the Earth before the boost 
to the Moon. The monthly factors are the lighting requirements at the landing site.
The landing should take place in the early lunar morning so that the Sun will be behind 
the astronauts as they approach from their east-to-west orbit. A low Sun-angle will also
produce shadows on the lunar terrain that allow the Commander to recognize landmarks as
well as aiding speed and distance perception. With a lunar day lasting 29.5 Earth days,
the correct conditions for the landing only occur monthly.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[The first launch window for Apollo 14 begins at 15:23, Eastern Standard Time,
January 31, 1971, and lasts almost four hours.
If technical problems or poor weather delay the launch,
they must wait until March, when they will have three opportunities
at the beginning of the month and another three at the end.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[Three hours before launch, the prime crew enters the spacecraft and once settled, they continue
the prelaunch checks. <a href="acron.htm#cdr"><font color=#202060>CDR</font></a> (Commander), Alan Shepard, takes the left couch facing the major flight
controls and the abort handle. <a href="acron.htm#cmp"><font color=#202060>CMP</font></a> (Command Module Pilot), Stuard Roosa occupies the center couch,
facing the caution and warning panel and ready to monitor the computer's display
during the critical minutes of ascent.
<a href="acron.htm#lmp"><font color=#202060>LMP</font></a> (Lunar Module Pilot), Edgar Mitchell, takes the right couch and monitors the
electrical and environment systems during launch.]</blockquote>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Kennedy Launch Control at
T-1 hour, 30 minutes and counting now 90 minutes away from the
Apollo 14 liftoff. All aspects of the countdown still running
smoothly at this time. In fact, a number of non-time
critical items have been accomplished well ahead of their
prescribed time in the countdown. We're essentially ahead
in the count with all going well. At the white room level
the closeout crew now has completed purging the cabin, bringing
it to the proper environment and they are just doing the
finishing touches on placing the boost protector cover on
the hatch. All aspects going well with the count. Other
work in process during this period is Spacecraft Commander
Alan Shepard now has come back on line with the spacecraft
test conductor and is securing from this rather extensive
emergency detection system checks that had been in progress.
Now, here in the firing room, we're performing some special
tests of the flight computer. We're running it through a
prepare to launch mode, exercising the flight computer to
insure that it will, in fact, operate satisfactorily in
flight. Houston flight is standing by at this time to send
some commands to the launch vehicle. This will be coming
up in a few minutes. This is Mitch, the flight director
in Houston has the capability of sending commands to the
vehicle in flight. We want to check this at this point to
be sure that the Houston commands actually will get through
to the vehicle and that it is verified. We're at 1 hour,
28 minutes, 29 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch
Control.

[Before the voyage commences, there are two sections to the <a href="acron.htm#csm"><font color=#202060>CSM</font></a> Launch Checklist to be followed.
The lift-off configuration is set and verified by the back-up <a href="acron.htm#cmp"><font color=#202060>CMP</font></a>, in
this case Ronald Evens, who checks that each switch, knob, adjustment and talkback indicator
is correctly set for the arrival of the prime crew. The <a href="acron.htm#csm"><font color=#202060>CSM</font></a> launch Checklist systematically
covers each of the 57 panels in the Apollo 14 <a href="acron.htm#csm"><font color=#202060>CSM</font></a>.
The Apollo 15 checklist, which is quite similar to that of Apollo 14, contains 454 lines.
Some panels are covered by a single line, while panel 2 on the main display console requires 78 lines.
<p>
<a href="pics/ad019.gif"><img src="pics/ad019.gif" width=400 height=192 alt="Main Display Console"></a>
<p>
<i>Command Module Main Display Console from Apollo Operations Handbook Block II Spacecraft
(October 15, 1969). This console comprises panels 1, 2 and 3, and is very similar, though
not identical, to the console in the Apollo 14 Command Module. This and other diagrams of
the Apollo spacecraft are available from the
<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/diagrams/apollo.html">Diagram
page of the NASA History Website</a></i>
<p>
At first glance, the number of displays, dials, and switches makes the console appear to be overwhelming.
On closer inspection, it might appear to be less than a prime example of ergometric excellence.
However, anyone familiar with the <a href="acron.htm#csm"><font color=#202060>CSM</font></a> systems would soon feel quite comfortable with it.]</blockquote>

T-minus 1 hour, 23 minutes and counting. All still proceeding
very smoothly with the Apollo 14 count at this time. Astronaut
Alan Shepard aboard the Apollo 14 spacecraft now busy
with the start of some extensive guidance and command checks
that will be in progress for the next 10 or 15 minutes or so.
This starts with checks of stabilization and control system
of the spacecraft and also checks out the various guidance
controls on board. T-minus 1 hour, 22 minutes, 29 seconds

[The Apollo 14 Saturn V stack now standing on the launch platform on pad 39 A 
is 363 feet [110.6 m] high.
With an expected take off weight of 6,505,500 pounds [2,950,900 kg], it will be some
3800 pounds [1700 kg]
heavier than Apollo 13, making it the heaviest rocket yet launched by the U.S.
At the bottom of the stack is the 138 ft high [42.1 m], 33 ft [10 m] in diameter

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Kennedy Launch Control at
T minus one hour ten minutes and counting, now 70 minutes
away from the Apollo 14 liftoff. We're still proceeding
very satisfactorily at this time. Our weather posture seems
to be improving. However, we are still keeping a close look
on that weather front to the west of us. A squall in front
of it seems to be breaking up. However, it is still being
looked at closely. As far as weather in the Atlantic Ocean,
which had had high seas and some high winds, it appears that
the most severe aspect of that weather will be north of the
trajectory on the flight. This is the area that would be
concerned with am emergency abort condition. It is predicted
that the more severe weather will not move into - anywhere
along the line of the track. As a result, we appear to be
Go as far as the abort weather conditions are concerned. In
the meanwhile, Alan Shepard, the spacecraft commander, now in
the midst of his guidance and control checks working with
spacecraft conductor Skip Chauvin. At one point in this
test he does actually drive that big service propulsion system
engine below him. He actually gimbals the engine, has
it sway in response to commands from the spacecraft. We also
are checking here in the firing room two of the two tracking
beacons on the launch vehicle that are used for C-band radar
tracks during the powered phase of the flight. Astronauts
Dave Scott and Jim Erwin, the commander and lunar module
pilots of the Apollo 15 mission, are here in the firing room
at this time, and they are at this point talking with acting
administrator George Low and Dr. Werner von Braun. Our
countdown is proceeding, T minus one hour 8 minutes, 17 seconds
and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.

and 33 feet [10 m] in diameter.
With a dry weight of 78,100 pounds [35,400 kg], it weighs 1,075,900 pounds [488,000 kg]
at ignition.
The five J-2 rockets motors clustered at its base produce a total of 1,150,000 pounds
[5,115 kN] of thrust at the start of its burn.]</blockquote>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Kennedy Launch Control at
T-60 minutes and counting. T-60, one hour away from the
Apollo 14 liftoff. All aspects of the countdown still proceeding
very satisfactorily at this time. As a matter of
fact, a number of events with some 10 or 15 minutes ahead
of the assigned work in the countdown manual. Because of
this the Apollo access arms swing on number 9, will probably
come back about 10 minutes earlier than it usually would in
the countdown. By coming back early, it will be moving in
about 7 or 8 minutes from this point. It's moved 12 degrees
from the spacecraft -- that's about 6 feet [2 m] -- and remains in
that standby position until a 5 minute mark in the count
when it's fully retracted. A short while ago Alan Shepard
was told by the Spacecraft Test Conductor, Skip Chauvin,
things were going very well and that we were ahead on the
count. Alan at that point said thank him for the information
and said how's the weather out there. The reply came back
that there is some cover but it looks pretty fair. Actually
the clouds we have in the area at the present time have a
base of about 3,000 feet [1,000 m] and extend up to 8,000 feet [2,500 m] with some
getting as high as 12,000 feet [3,500 m]. This does not appear to be
any constraint to a launch attempt as far as the cloud cover
is concerned at this time. That's our status. The countdown
is still running smoothly. We're Go on Apollo 14.

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Kennedy Launch Control, T-55 minutes
and counting. T-55 and counting all still proceeding very
satisfactorily with Apollo 14. We've just completed some
telemetry checks of the launch vehicle as the launch continues.
The astronaut crew has been advised that the swing arm, the
Apollo access arm swing on number 9 will be coming back in about
a minute and 40 seconds from this time. We will remain in a
standby position about 6 feet [2 m] from the spacecraft until we
reach the five minute mark in the count when it will be fully
retracted. The pad leader and the closeout crew have departed
from the 320 foot level and are now at the roadblock position
standing by. For an update on network operations concerned with
the mission, we now switch to mission control in Houston.

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, Houston at
minus 54 minutes and counting. The worldwide manned space flight
network is prepared for launch at this time. Only
one problem has emerged. This is a very minor problem. At
Carnarvon C-band coverage is red because of computer problems,
however, this gives no constraint to launch because of
the unified S-band coverage in that area. Weather conditions
along the ground track across the Atlantic are expected to
be satisfactory as it has been reported with one area of
high winds and seas midway between Florida and Bermuda. In
the area we expect southwesterly winds of some 25 to 30 knots
and seas of 8 to 12 feet [4 m]. Here in Mission Control except
for a few more people than we see in simulations, it's much
the same. A quiet calmness best describes the mood of the
control center as the Houston Flight Control Team monitors
the final countdown now in progress. However, in less than
an hour the atmosphere here will change when the control of
the flight switches to Houston. Our flight director today,
Pete Frank will be calling for rapid status reports from each
member of the his team throughout the booster or powered
phase of flight. Over what is known as the flight director's
loop we expect to hear a great deal from a gentleman named
Dave Reed, our flight dynamics officer and Frank Van Rensiler
the booster systems engineer. Since they will be monitoring
the crucial trajectory and launch vehicle data. We're at
minus 52 minutes and this is Apollo Control Houston.
"<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Kennedy Launch Control,
we're now 52 minutes, 13 seconds and counting. And as the
astronauts were alerted, it did occur. The Apollo access arm
now has been retracted and is in the standby position. As soon
as the arm is retracted, the pyrotechnic systems within the
spacecraft are armed. This means now that 155 [000] pound thrust
escape tower that is atop of the spacecraft can be deployed in
a critical emergency if necessary from this point down in the
countdown. 51 minutes, 42 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy
Launch Control.

<blockquote>
[The Saturn V launch vehicle is assembled, transported on,
and launched from the Mobile Launcher. This structure consists of a base platform 48.8 x 41.1 meters
and 7.6 meters high with a 13.7 meter square hole over which the vehicle is mounted.
(The platforms will later be converted for use by the Space Shuttle.) Sprouting from one end
of this platform is the <a href="acron.htm#lut"><font color=#202060>LUT</font></a> (Launch Umbilical Tower). This 116 meter tower bears nine swing
arms which provide the ground crew with access points to the vehicle,
and a wide range of services including fuel, <a href="acron.htm#lox"><font color=#202060>LOX</font></a>, hydraulics, electrical power and various gases
for purging and pressurization.
These arms are articulated so they can swing away from the vehicle to give it clearance as
it rises, and to protect them from the rocket's white hot exhaust gases.
The crew enter the spacecraft via the top, or ninth, arm, which carries an
environmentally controlled room at its end. Known as the &quot;white room&quot;,
it covers the <a href="acron.htm#cm"><font color=#202060>CM</font></a> hatch until the crew is aboard. 43 minutes before launch,
it is swung away from the spacecraft by 12&deg;. Five minutes before launch,
it completes its retraction to 180&deg;, on the opposite side of the tower from the Saturn V.]</blockquote>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Kennedy Launch Control.
T minus 45 minutes and counting. T minus 45 still Go with
Apollo 14 in the countdown at this time. Just a matter of
a few minutes ago astronaut Stu Roosa wound up pressurizing
the reaction control system of the Service Module on the
spacecraft. These are the big 100 lb. thrust engines which
are in quadrants - 4 quadrants around the side of the
Service Module which are used for certain types of spacecraft
maneuvers on the trajectory to and from the moon. Stu Roosa
read out the various pressures involved in the different
quadrants and they were recorded by the spacecraft test
conductor. Coming up in a matter of a few minutes will be
one of the final major checks of the range safety command
destruct system aboard the vehicle. These are the destruct
packages in each of the stages which would be initiated in
the event the vehicle veered violently off trajectory and
could be a danger to anyone or anything below. Of course
before destruct action would ever occur the escape tower
first would be triggered on the spacecraft to successfully
separate the astronauts from the vehicle in trouble.

<blockquote>
[Each stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle has shaped
explosive charges attached to its outer surface which, in the event of an abort, rupture the
fuel and oxidizer tanks, dispersing their contents into the atmosphere rather than allow them
to impact the Earth with dangerous loads still on board. The charge for the <a href="acron.htm#sic"><font color=#202060>S-IC</font></a> (the designation
of the first stage) cuts a longitudinal breach in the fuel tank on the opposite side of the vehicle
from that for the oxidizer tank so as to minimize their mixing during dispersion. Charges for the
<a href="acron.htm#sii"><font color=#202060>S-II</font></a> (second stage) cut a 9 meter longitudinal opening in the hydrogen fuel tank and a series of
lateral 4 meter ruptures in the squat <a href="acron.htm#lox"><font color=#202060>LOX</font></a> (liquid oxygen) tank. Those for the <a href="acron.htm#sivb"><font color=#202060>S-IVB</font></a> (third stage)
make two parallel 6 meter openings in the fuel tank and a 1.2 meter diameter hole in the <a href="acron.htm#lox"><font color=#202060>LOX</font></a> tank.

external power on the vehicle to the batteries in each of
the three stages and the instrument unit of the Saturn 5.
This test is in progress at this time and after we are
assured that all batteries are operating satisfactorily,

the final countdown and we were advised that the ten minute
mark on the count, that it appeared one particular cloud
cell coming across the Indian River that is coming west over
the launch pad area appeared to have rain in it and some
potential and it was reaching up to altitudes of some
15,000 feet [4,500 m]. As a result, the Launch Director, Walt Kapryan
determined that we should Hold. We're going to remain in
this posture at approximately 8 minute mark to try to be
no more than some 10 minutes away from a launch attempt as
long as this is possible. We are going to be advised by
the flying aircraft of conditions and hopefully be able to
get a forecast that things will look better in 15 minute
increments. That is when we get a Go from the aircraft, we
will be able to launch some 15 minutes later. So we do not
have a firm estimate at this time. However, the aircraft
commander has advised that he feels he will be able to give
us one in a short while. That is our situation, standing by
at 8 minutes and 2 seconds and Holding. The Apollo 14 crew
has been advised. They're also standing by in the spacecraft.

[At the time of the Apollo 12 launch, the mission rules covering
weather minimums for a launch were a bit looser.
Neither thick clouds nor rain were a problem
if the winds were light and there was no lightning or indications
of impending lightning.  So Apollo 12 started in the rain and quickly
climbed into heavy cloud.  Just 36 seconds later, it was hit by at least
one lightning bolt.  The master caution alarm sounded when most of the
electrical and navigation systems were knocked off line.
The command module pilot, Richard Gordon, only slightly exaggerated when he looked
at the caution and warning panel and reported that "all the lights are on."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, the Saturn V booster continued to run perfectly and shortly after reaching
orbit, the crew managed to get everything back up and running.
But the very successful ten day mission came uncomfortably close to a very dramatic
end, less than a minute after it started.  So NASA tightened the rules and Apollo 14
has to wait for the clouds to move past.]</blockquote>

thrust is confirmed.
A pneumatic device collapses the lever linkage to allow the arm to rise.
If any one of these arms fail to release within 36 milliseconds of the expected time,
an explosive device will be triggered to force the release of the arm.
Additionally, a number of controlled-release mechanisms
(up to 16, depending on the mission) prevent the vehicle from accelerating too rapidly
in the first moments of motion. These consist of tapered pins mounted to the pad which
are pulled through dies mounted on the vehicle. The deformation of the pins controls
the initial acceleration for the first 150 mm of flight; a simple and ingenious arrangement.]</blockquote>

be aborted and the <a href="acron.htm#cm"><font color=#202060>CM</font></a> with the crew onboard will be either safely returned to Earth or enter
a safe orbit.
There are several different abort modes available, each optimized for a certain
phase of the launch.
During the first part of the launch, the Mode 1A is in effect.
At the start of a Mode 1A abort, the <a href="acron.htm#lvdc"><font color=#202060>LVDC</font></a> is told to shut down the F-1 engines and self
destruct.
At the same time  the <a href="acron.htm#cm"><font color=#202060>CM</font></a> separates from the <a href="acron.htm#sm"><font color=#202060>SM</font></a> and the rest of the <a href="acron.htm#lv"><font color=#202060>LV</font></a>, and
the launch Escape Tower (<a href="acron.htm#let"><font color=#202060>LET</font></a>) pulls the <a href="acron.htm#cm"><font color=#202060>CM</font></a> to safety.
The <a href="acron.htm#let"><font color=#202060>LET</font></a> is capable of accelerating the <a href="acron.htm#cm"><font color=#202060>CM</font></a> at about 7g.  At that rate it would be up to
100 km/h in well under 1/2 seconds and could do the standing quarter mile in 3.5 seconds,
leaving even a top fuel dragster behind.
In order to move the <a href="acron.htm#cm"><font color=#202060>CM</font></a> away from the launch pad and out over the Atlantic were it can make a
safe landing, a pitch motor is used to tilt the <a href="acron.htm#cm"><font color=#202060>CM</font></a>/<a href="acron.htm#let"><font color=#202060>LET</font></a> eastwards.
About 11 seconds later, three seconds after the main <a href="acron.htm#let"><font color=#202060>LET</font></a> motor burns out, a pair of
canards (small airfoils) deploy from the top of the <a href="acron.htm#let"><font color=#202060>LET</font></a> to help turn the <a href="acron.htm#cm"><font color=#202060>CM</font></a> around.
While this is going on, the highly dangerous hypergolic propellants of the <a href="acron.htm#cm"><font color=#202060>CM</font></a>'s <a href="acron.htm#rcs"><font color=#202060>RCS</font></a> are
automatically dumped overboard.  After just 14 seconds, the <a href="acron.htm#let"><font color=#202060>LET</font></a>s job is done
and it is jettisoned with the help of a small rocket motor.
The <a href="acron.htm#cm"><font color=#202060>CM</font></a> then deploys its parachutes and lands in the Atlantic.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
At 42 seconds after liftoff, the abort mode is switched to 1B.
Since the <a href="acron.htm#lv"><font color=#202060>LV</font></a> has already pitched over and is moving out over the Atlantic, the pitch motor
is no longer needed during an abort.  The rest of the Mode 1B sequence is very similar to
a Mode 1A abort.
<P>
Scott, from 1998 correspondence - &quot;The 'abort' function was so very critical in terms
of success/failure that many people thought there should be no crew function,
and it should all be automatic (which in turn would introduce other more consequential failure modes).
The most difficult simulations during the entire training process were
'launch aborts' - even more so than lunar landings (the landing itself was more
difficult than launch, but not for 'aborts'). More crews 'bought it' during launch
sims than any other area, by far!&quot;]</blockquote>

[Until now, the <a href="acron.htm#iu"><font color=#202060>IU</font></a> has been following a predetermined trajectory to minimizes lateral
aerodynamic loads without using (feeding back) any information about current position or
velocity.  This is called &quot;open loop&quot; control since the results of the last
guidance command are not being fed back to help compute future commands.
The <a href="acron.htm#iu"><font color=#202060>IU</font></a> now begins the IGM (Iterative Guidance Mode) which closes the guidance loop by using
the difference between where it is and where it wants to be to correct its guidance commands.

it into exactly the desired orbit.]</blockquote>

to 776,000 pounds [3,450 kN],
a drop of 16 %, but with about a 1 % improvement in specific impulse (fuel efficiency).
Despite the reduction in thrust, during the technical debriefing, Roosa twice said that
&quot;It just felt like you cut in the AS (afterburner) on the stack.&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The PU system was originally designed to automatically adjust the mixture ratio
to ensure that both the fuel and the oxidizer were depleted at the same time.
However, the system was later simplified to an on/off operation designed
to reduce thrust and achieve a small gain in efficiency.]</blockquote>

[This first burn of the <a href="acron.htm#sivb"><font color=#202060>S-IVB</font></a> was 4.1 seconds shorter than was predicted.
This was due mostly to over-performace of the <a href="acron.htm#sivb"><font color=#202060>S-IVB</font></a>.
For sixty seconds during its burn, the engine has been refilling
the spherical Start Tank with gaseous hydrogen. This will be used to respin the turbines
when the engine is restarted for the boost out of Earth orbit.
The helium tank within the Start Tank does not need to be refilled as there is sufficient
in it for three or four restarts.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[On reaching orbit, the <a href="acron.htm#aps"><font color=#202060>APS</font></a> (Auxiliary Propulsion System, the <a href="acron.htm#sivb"><font color=#202060>S-IVB</font></a>'s own attitude control system),
will continue to control the attitude of the <a href="acron.htm#lv"><font color=#202060>LV</font></a> making sure that it will fly in a level attitude
relative to the local horizon.
This requires that it set up a  slow pitch rotation at a rate which matches the vehicle's rate of
rotation about the Earth (therefore called 'orb rate') so that throughout the orbit,
the same side keeps facing Earth. In this case the crew is in a 'heads down' attitude
and the vehicle is pointing in the direction of travel.
<p>
There seem to be a number of interrelated reasons for the orb rate maneuver during the
Earth parking orbit. They entered orbit nearly &quot;pointy-end-forward&quot;
and will boost to the Moon (the <a href="acron.htm#tli"><font color=#202060>TLI</font></a> or Translunar Injection burn) in a similar attitude.
Staying in that same attitude, relative to the local horizontal, avoids excessive attitude changes.
Also, this attitude presents a small cross section to the extremely thin atmosphere
that the spacecraft and <a href="acron.htm#sivb"><font color=#202060>S-IVB</font></a> is still moving through, and this minimizes friction induced heating.
It may be preferable for the small thrust resulting from the venting of
<a href="acron.htm#lh"><font color=#202060>LH</font></a><sub>2</sub> to push the vehicle in the same direction as orbital motion.
Finally, keeping the <a href="acron.htm#csm"><font color=#202060>CSM</font></a> in a 'heads down' attitude ensures that the spacecraft's optics,
mounted on the opposite side of the Command Module from the hatch,
are facing towards the stars so Al can sight on them during the upcoming navigation tasks.]</blockquote>
