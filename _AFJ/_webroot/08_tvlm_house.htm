<b>060:39:35 Mitchell:</b> Houston, 14.<p>

<b>060:39:37 Haise:</b> Go ahead.<p>

<b>060:39:42 Mitchell:</b> Roger. We're in the process of pressurizing the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> now, as you can
probably see. We're holding for the integrity check at this point. I have the television set up
and I can turn it on at your command.<p>

<b>060:39:59 Haise:</b> Okay, Ed. Stand by on the TV, we'll see if they're ready.<p>

<b>060:40:08 Haise:</b> Okay. They're all set up, Ed; you can turn it on any time.<p>

<b>060:40:15 Mitchell:</b> Houston, I'm transmitting. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:40:38 Haise:</b> Okay. We got the picture, Ed.<p>

<b>060:40:43 Mitchell:</b> Roger, Houston. You should be able to recognize it. There's the
Commander's number 1 window. There's its field of view at the moment. And Alan is up in the tunnel
working the pressurization procedure. Stuart is coming up from under the Commander's seat - you
can see his head starting to come into the field of view now - from stowing items down under the
seat. Let's see if I can get a little better picture here for you. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:41:26 Haise:</b> Yes. Stu's head looks pretty good in color there. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:41:40 Roosa:</b> You mean that color wheel can handle red, Fredo?<p>

<b>060:41:46 Haise:</b> Yes. It seems to be doing a pretty good job there. I noticed some speckles
on the window there. Is that - did y'all end up with a little debris on there?<p>

<b>060:41:57 Mitchell:</b> We have a few ice crystals, apparently, that have adhered to it from
the various dumps we've made.<p>

<b>060:42:04 Roosa:</b> You know, Fredo, that window was clean as all get out
until we started all the dumping. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:42:22 Mitchell:</b> Houston. We're continuing the pressurization procedure. We've just
opened up the pressurization valve between the two spacecraft. And we're flowing into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> from
the command module. Give you a picture if you can see it here. There's our cabin pressure gage,
shows your quantity as well. Let's see if I can get it in view. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:42:59 Haise:</b> A little dark and out of focus there right now, Ed.<p>

<b>060:43:05 Mitchell:</b> Yes. It's a little too close. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:43:17 Haise:</b> Yes. That's a little better, I can now see the - your little card there
showing the antenna patterns. But the needles on the gage is a little hard to read. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:43:44 Mitchell:</b> We'll give up on that, Fredo. Our pressure is equal between the command
module and the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>, and we will start removing tunnel hardware at this point.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>060:44:53 Haise:</b> Okay. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:45:18 Mitchell:</b> And, Houston, we're starting to shoot up into the tunnel here where -
Alan Shepard is starting to pull the hatch out - if I can get him to look down
for a minute and say hello to the world.<p>

<b>060:45:32 Haise:</b> Okay, Ed. I can see a form there that I guess is Al. It's - this picture
is just a little bit dark. You can see the lights up in the tunnel.<p>

<b>060:45:45 Mitchell:</b> Roger. I think we'll have just a little bit more light once this hatch
gets out of the way. We have all of our floodlights on full right now. While they're doing that,
let's slide out to the <a href="acron.html#cdr">CDR</a>'s window and take a look at the Moon, which happens
to be right out the window. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:46:22 Mitchell:</b> Going to coach me a little bit, Fred, as I approach this?<p>

<b>060:46:27 Haise:</b> Okay, we can see it now; it's right down in the lower right quadrant of
the window. The picture, though, we're seeing is a crescent, and it's really
not showing too much of the detail, Ed. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:46:57 Haise:</b> Okay. Assume you're zooming the camera now, Ed. And we
lost the picture of the Moon.<p>

<b>060:47:08 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Let me try it again. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:47:23 Haise:</b> Okay. I think what happened when you zoomed, Ed, you
ended up pointing above it. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:47:44 Mitchell:</b> Do you see anything now, Fredo?<p>

<b>060:47:46 Haise:</b> Okay, it just disappeared out the lower right corner.
We had it there for a little while.<p>

<b>060:47:58 Mitchell:</b> Okay. How now?<p>

<b>060:48:02 Haise:</b> Okay. There, it barely came in the bottom portion of the picture now.
Whereabouts is the terminator now? Is that about Tranquility, somewhere in there ?<p>

<b>060:48:16 Mitchell:</b> It's past Tranquility, and I think it's - it's approaching zero
longitude at this point, I believe.<p>

<b>060:48:28 Haise:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>060:48:29 Roosa:</b> A few hours ago we just passed Delta 'Tegnius [?], Fred.<p>

<b>060:48:39 Haise:</b> Yes. Right, Stu.<p>

<b>060:48:44 Roosa:</b> Roger. It - I was looking through the sextant there just a minute ago. It
- all of Descartes - around Descartes and the Highlands showed up real well and the terminator had
just moved on over just past Platte [?]. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:49:05 Haise:</b> Okay. And for your information, in the audience in the back here, we have
most of the family in tonight - this morning down here, I should say.<p>

<b>060:49:18 Roosa:</b> Yes. 3:15 is a good time of night to have a TV show.<p>

<b>060:49:23 Haise:</b> Prime time. Yes, that's about right in the center of the picture now. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:49:38 Mitchell:</b> Okay. I've got full zoom on it, Fredo. And maybe it's too bright. Let's
see if I can darken it. It'll improve the picture a little.<p>

<b>060:49:47 Haise:</b> Yes, you're right. It's so bright, Ed, we're - we have
the crescent, but not too much detail on.<p>

<b>060:49:57 Haise:</b> Yes, that's a little better.<p>

<b>060:50:06 Mitchell:</b> And from our point of view, the Moon appears about the size of a
grapefruit, held at the arm's length. It's going to get considerably bigger, and if I don't have
the Earth to compare it with at the moment. But I suspect they are about the same size or maybe
the Moon is starting to exceed the Earth in apparent size, [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:50:37 Haise:</b> Okay. And the big board now has you at ...<p>

<b>060:50:40 Mitchell:</b> Okay. We'll go ...<p>

<b>060:50:41 Haise:</b> ... about ... 180,000 out.<p>

<b>060:50:46 Mitchell:</b> Roger. Okay, I'm going to come back inside. We have now stowed the
hatch. And Stu and Al are up starting to bring the probe out. And very soon we'll be able to make
the trip into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> with the camera and see what we can find in there. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:51:09 Mitchell:</b> We have not, as you can obviously see, rehearsed this. Our procedures
are new to us, going into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> for the first time. And, as a matter of fact, we were a little
bit rushed getting the pressurization procedure complete in order to get in on time. We'll be
ready here in about 2 minutes to move on into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>, I think. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:51:36 Haise:</b> Okay, Ed.<p>

<b>060:51:38 Mitchell:</b> And, now, let's go back inside the command module. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:52:40 Haise:</b> Okay. Are we looking up in the tunnel area now, Ed?
It's pretty dark right now.<p>

<b>060:52:48 Roosa:</b> Yes, I'll be bringing the probe out ...<p>

<b>060:52:50 Mitchell:</b> Yes, I'm trying to, Fred, but it's dark. Just 1 second, I'll see if I
can improve the light situation for us.<p>

<b>060:52:56 Haise:</b> Roger. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:53:29 Mitchell:</b> Okay. You're looking directly up into the tunnel now. The probe has
been released from the drogue, and Stu will be bringing it straight down through the tunnel.<p>

<b>060:53:41 Haise:</b> Yes. We got that picture in pretty good now. We can see it coming on down. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:54:23 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Houston. Al and Stu are taking the probe down
under the right-hand couch now.<p>

<b>060:54:34 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:54:59 Haise:</b> Yes, we can see Al in the picture now.<p>

<b>060:55:04 Mitchell:</b> Okay. He's probably clearer for you than he is on
our monitor. It's a little dark in here.<p>

<b>060:55:15 Shepard:</b> You can look up the tunnel and see the drogue
[Garbled], Ed, and I'll go and pick it up for you. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:55:31 Mitchell:</b> Okay. You're looking directly at the drogue now, which is gray in color
and which has a hole in the center above the capture latches. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:55:54 Haise:</b> In our color pictures here, the opening in the drogue
looks red in color. Like a big red eye.<p>

<b>060:56:07 Mitchell:</b> Okay. And Alan has it out and he's starting to come down the tunnel
with it. That's probably a little dark for you, but he's coming down anyhow.<p>

<b>060:56:21 Haise:</b> Okay, and we've temporarily, I hope, lost our picture down here, Ed.<p>

<b>060:56:29 Mitchell:</b> Okay. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:57:23 Mitchell:</b> Fred, do you have your picture back yet?<p>

<b>060:57:25 Haise:</b> Negative, Ed. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:58:07 Haise:</b> And 14, the problem with the loss of picture is on our end of the street.<p>

<b>060:58:15 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Tell me when you have it back and we're ready
to go through into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>.<p>

<b>060:58:24 Haise:</b> Okay. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:59:08 Haise:</b> And, Ed, Houston. You may continue the commentary, I guess. It's being
received out at the site and being recorded; we're just not getting it - plumbed into here.<p>

<b>060:59:24 Mitchell:</b> Okay. While we were just holding up here, Alan has slipped on through
into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> and is opening up the window shades and turning on the lights, so that as we go in, we
will have some lights to give you a little better picture. I'm waiting here until - to get your
picture back before I start in; however, if you would like, I'll go ahead and go into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>.<p>

<b>060:59:51 Haise:</b> Stand by 1, Ed. Okay, Ed. They don't have an estimate right now. We might
wait a couple of minutes; and then, I guess, if we haven't got it back, you can proceed. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:00:12 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Okay, Alan's coming back through the tunnel
now and it will be clear here in a minute. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:01:15 Mitchell:</b> Houston, while we're waiting for your picture to come back and, since
it is being recorded at the site, we will take a quick station break and let
Alan give us a commercial for Apollo 14.<p>

<b>061:01:33 Haise:</b> Okay. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:01:47 Shepard:</b> Okay. Apollo 14 is progressing very nicely. As you can see, we're now
right on schedule. And it looks as though the first midcourse correction is going to put us in for
the lunar orbit insertion burn - very close. We're - we're currently preparing to go into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>
as Ed has told you; and, so far, everything is working very well in the command module. We're very
pleased with the way the systems are working. Everything is quiet, going along extremely smoothly,
and we have a happy little ship here. Everyone is well. Everyone is resting well. We're adapting
to weightlessness, I think, very rapidly. And everything is going along very
smoothly at this point. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:02:43 Haise:</b> Roger, Al. And we have a picture back now. It's just a little bit on the
dark side, but we can see you quite well.<p>

<b>061:02:55 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Fredo. We'll start on in.<p>

<b>061:03:06 Mitchell:</b> Okay. How's that?<p>

<b>061:03:10 Haise:</b> Hey, that's a good picture, Ed.<p>

<b>061:03:15 Shepard:</b> Okay. We're starting through the tunnel.<p>

<b>061:03:24 Shepard:</b> Why don't you show the docking latches while you go by, Ed. See how they
look on the television. Can you see the docking latches, Fredo?<p>

<b>061:03:32 Haise:</b> Roger. We can see those, Ed. We can see on down to the tunnel and the top
of the ascent engine cover.<p>

<b>061:03:44 Mitchell:</b> Okay. I think it's significant that, in spite of our problem the other
day, that when Stu - Stu finally got us into the docking ring that all of them snapped shut, which
is - was very well lined up. And our docking index, as you know, cost us a case of beer, I think,
because it's within 1 degree. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:04:17 Haise:</b> Okay. And you might let us know, Ed, how you find the
fit through the tunnel there.<p>

<b>061:04:26 Mitchell:</b> Okay. I'm sliding through.<p>

<b>061:04:29 Roosa:</b> Hey, was that question from Joe?<p>

<b>061:04:36 Haise:</b> I'm not sure he'd own up to it.<p>

<b>061:04:42 Mitchell:</b> Okay. I'm through the tunnel, and I'm right at the top of the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>. I'm
shining the - showing the camera down on the main console on the Commander's
side. How's that picture, Fredo?<p>

<b>061:04:57 Haise:</b> Okay. That looks very good, Ed.<p>

<b>061:05:03 Mitchell:</b> And let's see. I'll turn it around. I'll go ahead and go on down and
twist around, and maybe we can look out the window. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:05:33 Mitchell:</b> And, we're now inside the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:05:53 Haise:</b> Thank you, Ed.<p>

<b>061:05:57 Mitchell:</b> Can you see that, Fred?<p>

<b>061:05:59 Haise:</b> Yes, we see what looks to be a patch there, Ed.<p>

<b>061:06:07 Mitchell:</b> Is it good enough for you to read it?<p>

<b>061:06:15 Haise:</b> Is it something like beep, beep or -<p>

<b>061:06:20 Mitchell:</b> How did you ever guess?<p>

<b>061:06:26 Roosa:</b> Must be some prompting from the ground.<p>

<b>061:06:35 Haise:</b> Okay. And, Ed, a good portion of your swing here, the picture is a little
bit on the dark side. You might try opening it up just a little bit more.<p>

<b>061:06:48 Mitchell:</b> Roger. I've had it open all the way, Fredo.<p>

<b>061:06:53 Haise:</b> Well, I guess you can't do any better than that. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:07:18 Haise:</b> Did you find the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> pretty clean, Ed, when y'all first
came aboard or was anything loose in there?<p>

<b>061:07:30 Mitchell:</b> No, both spacecraft, Fredo, have been immaculate. I think we have found
one washer floating along about 1 day ago, and we have seen nothing that was foreign to the
spacecraft either before or since that time. And, as I say that, I see one floating by me right
now. It may be the same washer. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:07:59 Shepard:</b> Yes, I'd like to point out that Ed is talking about something external
to the spacecraft. The cabin above the command module and the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> are extremely clean. We've been
very pleased with the way they've looked.<p>

<b>061:08:13 Haise:</b> Very good.<p>

<b>061:08:17 Roosa:</b> Yes, I think from what we've heard along the line, we actually expected
maybe to see a few more nuts and bolts. I think a lot of credit goes to checkout crew and
everything because this spacecraft is really in good shape. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:08:41 Mitchell:</b> And, Fredo, I'm passing the camera back to Alan in the command module.
We don't have enough light in here to really give you a good picture. And there's not much help
from the outside since the Sun is behind us right now.<p>

<b>061:08:56 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed. I - we got a pretty good picture of you
down in the tunnel right now. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:09:11 Roosa:</b> Hey, Fred. Did you hear that last comment I made about
the crew and how clean the spacecraft was?<p>

<b>061:09:18 Haise:</b> Roger, Stu.<p>

<b>061:09:21 Roosa:</b> Well, that was planted, you know, for all the authorized people that
worked on the spacecraft. You know, we're really unindated [sic] with unauthorized objects in both
spacecraft. I think Ed was showing you one up there, but if you could see this. I don't know if
any of the backup crew is down in there tonight or not. But - okay, how about - about here -
[Garbled] But, they've left their calling card. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:10:00 Haise:</b> Okay, we have a pretty good picture of that, Stu. And, they are here.<p>

<b>061:10:08 Roosa:</b> Okay. Tell them we sure appreciate every compartment that we open up
having one of these come floating out of it.<p>

<b>061:10:21 Haise:</b> They aim to please. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:10:37 Mitchell:</b> Stu, you want to take the camera? Perhaps you can move it on up to the
window. I don't know how much light there is, but sure is a good shot of the Moon out there. You
might try again with the monitor so you can see what it looks like to them.<p>

<b>061:10:49 Roosa:</b> Well, we'll give it a go. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:11:06 Haise:</b> Okay, we can see the Moon again in the number - number 1 window. It's down
in the lower left corner now, Stu. Hey, that's about right in the center. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:11:38 Haise:</b> Okay, that's - the picture's a little distorted now,
Stu. It's a little bright. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:12:04 Roosa:</b> Okay, that ought to help it a little.<p>

<b>061:12:07 Haise:</b> Yes, that's about right. It's still hard to see in this picture - much in
the way of detail of the features - any features on the surface. Right at the terminator, we can
pick up a few craters; but, other than that, it's really hard to see very much. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:12:37 Roosa:</b> Okay. Yes, I didn't think it was going to show up too much there, Fred,
because that's really the way it looks with the eye. It's just now starting, you know, to get into
the area where the larger craters would show up. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:13:21 Haise:</b> Okay, we've got a good picture of Al there, now.<p>

<b>061:13:27 Roosa:</b> Okay, he's got the transfer items that he's taking up into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> for the
activation, and he might just give you a word on what they are.<p>

<b>061:13:39 Shepard:</b> The purpose of the excursion into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> at this time is to check out
some of the communications, do a little housekeeping, look - generally look the vehicle over, and
also, in this particular case, we are going to take some pictures of the command module while
we're there. This is done during the flight on the way to the Moon to save time, so that when we
actually go into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> for the final time prior to the descent, there will be less things to do.
So, I have a package of things here in my hand which I'll now be taking up into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> and will
proceed on with our housekeeping tasks up there. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:14:24 Haise:</b> Okay, we can see him heading out with the package in hand there. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:14:43 Roosa:</b> Okay, is there enough light up in there, Fred? You getting the picture?<p>

<b>061:14:47 Haise:</b> Roger, Stu.<p>

<b>061:14:51 Roosa:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>061:14:53 Haise:</b> Looks like running an obstacle course in the early
going, getting by all the hoses.<p>

<b>061:15:01 Roosa:</b> You got it. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:15:18 Mitchell:</b> And, Fredo, I'm starting back through the tunnel now to pick up the
rest of the equipment. We have several 16- and 70-millimeter camera Mags that are being
transferred over. We'll pick those up and be right back with you.<p>

<b>061:15:35 Haise:</b> Okay, Ed.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>061:16:37 Haise:</b> Okay, I guess the picture I'm looking at now, as you're pointing back into
the <a href="acron.html#leb">LEB</a> in the area where the optics would be. And I can see the radiation meter back there.<p>

<b>061:16:50 Roosa:</b> Yes. Yes. That's affirmative, Fred; I'm just really trying to get the
camera out of the way there for a minute. Ed's got the other film magazine.
He's headed back up into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> now. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:17:20 Haise:</b> Yes, Ed fits through there quite easily. I guess zero g really does help.<p>

<b>061:17:31 Roosa:</b> (Laughter) [Garbled] no comment.<p>

<b>061:17:41 Mitchell:</b> If you're commenting on what I think you're commenting on, it was
totally uncalled for, Fredo. And, Houston, we are both - Al and I are both in the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> now with all
of our transfer items, and we will proceed to go ahead and give it a checkout as per the time line.<p>

<b>061:18:03 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:18:29 Roosa:</b> Okay, Fred. I'll try to move up here, and maybe we can
look over the shoulder a little bit.<p>

<b>061:18:35 Haise:</b> Okay. I can see a moving back and forth; I guess your
head is down through now. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:18:55 Roosa:</b> Okay, we're going to get a picture of it all up here, Fred. I'm up ahead
by the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> hatch now, trying to watch them work in the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>; but it doesn't look
like it's going to be bright enough. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:19:17 Haise:</b> Yes. It's - it's a pretty dark picture now, Stu.<p>

<b>061:19:23 Roosa:</b> Yes, I'm afraid that's not going to show up. If we had a little light, I
guess we need a little Sun through the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> window. [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:20:03 Mitchell:</b> Well, Houston, I guess Fred and I'll have to give you a show from - I
mean Stu and I'll have to give you a show from that side. It's too dark over here.<p>

<b>061:20:13 Mitchell:</b> [Garbled.]<p>

<b>061:20:19 Haise:</b> Okay. And you're cutting in and out there, Ed.<p>

<b>061:20:29 Mitchell:</b> Okay. How now? Is that better?<p>

there anybody that - who's interested in taking a look at those, or are you pretty well satisfied
that just taking still - still pictures of it from here on out will do the trick?<p>

<b>061:20:56 Haise:</b> Okay, Al. The word is the pictures should suffice. I - They're not that -
particularly interested in another look right now.<p>

before we sign out for the evening? [Long pause]<p>

<b>061:21:29 Haise:</b> Okay, Ed - Al. The - I guess the answer is no to your last question.<p>

<b>061:21:38 Mitchell:</b> Okay. In that case, we'll sign off from Apollo 14. We appreciate the
opportunity to show you around the spacecraft and a little bit of the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>; and I hope that next

<b>067:29:14 Fullerton:</b> Okay. They're - they're willing to sign you up for a permanent job at
doing that, if you'd like to after the flight.<p>

<b>067:29:26 Mitchell:</b> Well, we'll discuss it. [Long pause]<p>

<b>067:29:41 Shepard:</b> Houston, 14. If you're satisfied then, I'll return my comm configuration
to the sleep configuration.<p>

<b>067:29:47 Fullerton:</b> Okay. Let me make one quick check here. [Long pause]<p>

<b>067:30:01 Fullerton:</b> Well, I guess that's all we've got. We'll say good night once again.<p>

<b>067:30:08 Mitchell:</b> Thank you, Gordon.<blockquote>[Very long comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "67 hours, 30 minutes ground elapsed time.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. We show Apollo 14 at
32,470 nautical miles [60,134 km] away from the moon and now traveling
at a speed of 3311 feet per second [1,009 m/s] relative to the moon."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, Houston, at
68 hours 04 minutes into the flight - ground elapsed time.
We presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 31 392 nautical
miles [58,138 km] away from the moon and traveling at a speed of 3321
feet per second [1,012 m/s] relative to the moon. We've had no further
conversation with the crew of Apollo 14 since they were awakened
by Capcom Gordon Fullerton to check a high O2 flow rate. Presumably
the crew, if not yet sleeping, shortly will be. We're
at 68 hours 05 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, Houston. At
63 hours, 33 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 14. We
presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 30,431 nautical
miles [56,358 km] away from the moon, now traveling at a velocity of
3329 feet per second [1,015 m/s]. We've had no communications with the
crew. Since our last report, the crew now in its rest period -
they are in their rest period. Meanwhile, activity in Mission
Control has been conversations over the flight directors loop
have been quite subdued. It's been mainly a scene where flight
controllers are studying their displays, they are considering
the activities that will lie ahead on the next shift. A test
of one of the lunar modular batteries by spacecraft Commander,
Al Shepard, and Ed Mitchell is being considered either
at the time of <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> activation or before. Ascent battery number
5 has shown a reading of 3 tenths of a volt low on the open
circuit voltage. If the test is run, it would involve putting
the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> battery number 5, the one under question, on one
of the busses for an independent or second reading off another
transducer and provide a second data point. The present
reading is taken from the battery transducer without any
load. If the second reading indicates a shift in signal
conditioner then it would indicate faulty instrumentation
rather than a fault of the battery itself. We will stand by
and continue to monitor this possibility and provide updates
as they become available. We're at 68 hours, 35 minutes
ground elapsed time and this is Apollo Control, Houston."<p>
