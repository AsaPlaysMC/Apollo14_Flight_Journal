<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control Houston, at
44 hours, 32 minutes now into the flight. Apollo 14 is presently
149,338 nautical miles [276,574 km] out from earth. Its velocity now reading
3,384.9 feet per second [1,031.7 m/s]. We have had no communication with the
crew since our last report. The crew of Apollo 14 now well into
their rest period, our clock in mission control shows 6 hours
and 27 minutes remaining until time of wake up. Meanwhile the
surgeon is following data on spacecraft commander Al Shepard.
He reports that Shepard entered into a sound sleep at 43 hours,
43 minutes <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> time. We're at 44 hours, 33 minutes into the
flight, and this is Apollo Control Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, Houston, at
45 hours, 32 minutes now into the mission. Apollo 14 is now about
a distance of 151,272 nautical miles [280,156 km] away from the Earth.
It's now traveling at a speed of 3,329 feet per second [1,015 m/s]. We've
had no communications with the crew since our last report.
The crew is now well into its rest period - into their rest
period. One of our countdown clocks in the control center shows
a wake-up time of 5 hours, 27 minutes from this time. So at
45 hours, 33 minutes continuing to monitor, this is Apollo
Control, Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control Houston at
46 hours, 22 minutes into the mission. We now show Apollo 14
at 152,854 nautical miles [283,086 km] away from Earth, and its present
velocity 3,283 feet per second [1,001 m/s]. Our clock in mission control shows
4 hours, 37 minutes remaining on the rest period of the Apollo
14 crew. We would also like to repeat at this time an earlier
announcement, the Modular Space Station News Briefing is
scheduled to begin in about 5 minutes, at 1:30 pm. That's
5 minutes at 1:30 pm in the news center briefing room. At
46 hours, 23 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, Houston at
47 hours, 32 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 14. Our
displays presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 155,040
and traveling at a velocity of 3,202.6 feet per second [976.2 m/s].
Presently in Mission Control one of our bottom clocks is
counting down to the time of the GMI liftoff update. The
clock presently reads 6 hours, 57 minutes counting down
toward the <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> at 54 hours, 30 minutes. One change in the
flight plan and that concerns the housekeeping in the lunar
module. This will be done in the <a href="acron.html#ptc"><font color=#206020>PTC</font></a> or passive thermal
control mode to conserve <a href="acron.html#rcs"><font color=#206020>RCS</font></a> propellants. This scheduled
for 61 hours, 45 minutes comes after the clock update.
However, the ground elapsed time will remain exactly as that
shown in the flight time and the Central Standard Time will
remain essentially unchanged. It's been a very quiet day
over the Flight Director's loop. The individual flight
controllers monitoring their systems, talking to their
backrooms, really have very little to say of wide-spread
interest. We're at 47 hours, 34 minutes into the flight
and this is Apollo Control, Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, Houston, at
48 hours, 22 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 14. We
presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 156,579 nautical
miles [289,984 km] away from Earth, traveling at a speed of 3,178 feet
per second [969 m/s]. Meanwhile in Mission Control over the past
20 to 30 minutes flight director Pete Frank has been
discussing with his flight control team procedures for
Al Shepard and Ed Mitchell's lunar module housekeeping
chore scheduled for early tomorrow morning and flight plan
changes are emerging. Since there will be no midcourse
correction 3 scheduled, the current outlook is to move
the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> housekeeping forward by 1 hour. Moving forward to
61 hours, 20 minutes ground elapsed time from the previously
scheduled 62 hours, 20 minutes. This would also move the
television time forward by 1 hour, moving to 60 hours, 40
minutes ground elapsed time from the previously scheduled
61 hours, 45 minutes ground elapsed time. Honeysuckle will
be the station for this transmission. Considered into the
change - into the changes - is a revision back to the original
flight plan, where by we would not continue with PTCR, the
passive thermal control mode. The consideration given here
was that a waste water dump will have to be scheduled in
any case. The procedure to be followed would be to
schedule this dump as close as possible to the television and
the housekeeping. The advantage to moving forward by 1 hour
is to put the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> housekeeping activities all on one shift.
The previous planning or scheduling would have a shift change
with about 1 hour remaining in the activity. Also moments
ago the flight dynamics officer has passed along a new
set of updates for <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> impact. The coordinates now read
8 degrees, 40 minutes south, 26 degrees, 19 minutes west
at a ground elapsed time of 82 hours, 38 minutes, 3 seconds.
Uniquely the spacecraft, Apollo 14 will be passing over
the front side of the moon at the time of impact. This was
not the case in Apollo 12. It should be passing over a
longitude of 61 degrees east at time of impact along its
flight path. This would place it about 30 minutes away
from passing over the longitude of impact. We will shortly
be changing shift here in the Mission Control Center with
the maroon team coming in to replace the orange team of
flight controllers. The orange flight control team took
over this morning shortly before the crew entered its
rest period and we have not heard from them aside from the
first 15 or 20 minutes of our shift. We're at 48 hours, 26
minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, Houston
at 48 hours, 39 minutes into the flight. We now show
Apollo 14 at an altitude of 157,109 nautical miles [290,966 km], a
velocity of 3,163 feet per second [964 m/s]. We will repeat an
earlier announcement, that being, that we do have a flight
plan change emerging. Since there will mid-course correction
3, the current plan at mission control is to move the
lunar module housekeeping forward one hour. This would
move that time forward to 61 hours, 20 minutes ground
elapsed time. By the same token this would also move the
television transmission time forward one hour, moving to
60 hours, 45 minutes ground elapsed time. The Honeysuckle
Station would be the station having acquisition. Further
the decision has been made not to continue in the passive
thermal control - control mode during the lunar module
housekeeping period. This decision being made since there
is a requirement to have a waste water dump and the present
plan or outlook is to move the waste water dump to a time
close to the lunar module housekeeping. There is an
advantage to moving forward the housekeeping one hour,
this advantage being that all of the activity will take
place with one shift of flight controllers. We're in at
48 hours, 41 minutes into the flight and in Mission Control
we're in the process of hand over from the orange to the
maroon team of flight controllers. Since the Apollo 14
crew, Al Shepard, Stu Roosa, and Ed Mitchell were asleep
for the entire shift, there will be no change of shift
briefing scheduled. This is Apollo Control, Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 49 hours, 32
minutes. At this time in Mission Control the maroon team
headed by Flight Director Milton Windler has completed its
briefing. Each of the Flight Controllers reviewed the status
of the mission and the spacecraft with the Flight Director
and we find everything progressing smoothly at this time.
No problems with the spacecraft. The Surgeon reports that
all the crewmen are healthy. At this time in the sleep
period they've all gotten at least 6 good hours of sleep.
Sleep period is scheduled to last for another hour and
27 minutes. Some of the telemetry data would indicate that
there has been some stirring around in the spacecraft but
at the present time all three crewmen would appear to be
sleeping or at least resting. Coming up on this shift
among the activities is the clock update and this is
scheduled to occur in the flight plan at about 54 hours,
45 minutes ground elapsed time. Flight Director Milt Windler
advises us that that won't be an advent that'll occur at
any precise instant but will probably require a total of
about ten minutes to synch all the clocks together at the
updated time but at about 54 hours, 45 minutes we would plan
to jump ahead in ground elapsed time to about 55 hours,
25 minutes. The exact amount of time to be changed will
depend on assessments as to the need for midcourse correction
4 but the variation would be very slight, a matter of
seconds. At the present time the Flight Dynamics Officer
reports that the midcourse correction 4 if it is needed at all,
would appear to be around 2 feet per second [1 m/s]. The additional
tracking data shows the pericynthion to be coming closer to
the preferred 60 nautical miles [111 km] - we're presently showing
it at 65 and when initial tracking came in yesterday following
a midcourse correction maneuver, the data showed that the
pericynthion was about 67 nautical miles [124 km] and as expected and
as we've seen on previous missions, additional tracking tends
to confirm that the pericynthion is in fact lower than the
initial tracking shows. At the present time, we show
Apollo 14 traveling at a velocity of 3,117 feet per second [950 m/s]
and the spacecraft altitude right now is 158,778 nautical
miles [294,057 km]. We'll continue to stand by and come up as soon as
we hear any conversation from the crew. As I said the sleep
period is scheduled to end in about 1 hour and 25 minutes
from now. At 49 hours, 35 minutes this is Apollo Control,
Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 50 hours,
32 minutes and at the present time we're awaiting the crew's
awakening. The crew is scheduled to awake from this sleep
period in 27 hours, or rather 27 minutes, 45 seconds and
at the last check with the surgeon we hadn't seen any
indication that the crew was stirring at this time. During
part of the period of time since our last announcement, we've
been on a low bit rate data and have not had heart rates
from the crew, which of course is the primary indication
as to whether or not they're sleeping or beginning to
stir. At this time, Apollo 14 is 160,493 nautical miles [297,233 km]
from Earth, and the spacecraft velocity, 3,069 feet per
second [935 m/s]. This will be a relatively quiet shift as planned
in the flight plan. Coming up we have the clock update
which will occur at about 54 hours, 45 minutes. They'll
be running some checks on the S-band communications
equipment and the VHF system in preparation for the
bistatic radar test to be performed later in the mission.
And they'll be changing lithium hydroxide, on the lithium
hydroxide canisters in the command module. There's also
a crew exercise period scheduled at about 57 hours, that
would be using the in flight exerciser, which is an isometric,
isotonic type device. We'll be standing by for the
crew to awake and as soon as we get any conversation from
the spacecraft we'll come up again and begin covering the
air to ground live at that time. At 50 hours, 34 minutes
this is Apollo Control, Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 50 hours,
54 minutes. We just received a call from Al Shepard so we'll
pick up and follow any conversations live from this point on."<p>

<b>050:54:29 McCandless:</b> Apollo 14, this is Houston. Go ahead.<p>

<b>050:54:35 Shepard:</b> Good morning, Bruce. We're reading you loud and clear. We've completed
our postsleep checklist. We have the readouts for you when you're ready to copy.<p>

<b>050:54:46 McCandless:</b> Roger. Go ahead with the postsleep checklist.<p>

<b>050:54:52 Shepard:</b> Okay. The checklist is complete. We have the following readings: for
dosimeter, Al, 16041, slept 5 hours; Stu, 01038, slept 7 hours; Ed, 05038, slept 6-1/2 hours. [Long pause]<p>

<b>050:55:21 McCandless:</b> Okay, 14. Understand. Al 16041 and 5 hours; Stu
01038, 7 hours; Ed 05038, 6-1/2 hours. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>050:55:38 Shepard:</b> That's correct.

<b>051:03:10 McCandless:</b> Apollo 14, this is Houston. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:03:23 Shepard:</b> Good morning, Bruce. Go ahead.<p>

<b>051:03:26 McCandless:</b> Roger. I don't want to interrupt your eat period, but when you have a
convenient time, I have a - plan update for you. It's a fairly lengthy one.
Nothing in the immediate future though.<p>

<b>051:03:37 Shepard:</b> Okay. Stand by. Roger, stand by for about 5 minutes or so, and be
advised we completed the LiOH canister change at 5:00 hours and the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>/command
module <a href="acron.html#deltap">Delta-P</a> at 50:59 plus 0.95. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:03:57 McCandless:</b> Understand 0.95 for the <a href="acron.html#deltap">Delta-P</a> at 50:59.<p>

<b>051:04:07 Shepard:</b> That's affirm.<p>

<b>051:04:12 Roosa:</b> Hey, Bruce, I'll take that flight plan update. Proceed.<p>

<b>051:04:15 McCandless:</b> Okay, Stu, here we go. You may want to just get out the flight plan
and mark out the items as we go along, or you can copy it down, either way.<p>

<b>051:04:27 Roosa:</b> No, I'd rather work on the flight plan. You give me the right places to go.<p>

<b>051:04:31 McCandless:</b> Okay. Up through 59:20, that's 59 plus 20, everything is nominal. And
from there on, you take the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>/<a href="acron.html#cm">CM</a> <a href="acron.html#deltap">Delta-P</a> vent at 59 hours and 25 minutes and
move that up to 59 hours even. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:05:05 Roosa:</b> Okay, we'll move the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>/command module <a href="acron.html#deltap">Delta-P</a> vent up to 59 even.<p>

<b>051:05:10 McCandless:</b> Roger. Take the <a href="acron.html#p52">P52</a> that occurs at 59:45 and move
it up 10 minutes to commence at 59:35. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:05:29 Roosa:</b> Okay. We'll shoot a <a href="acron.html#p52">P52</a> at 59:35.<p>

<b>051:05:33 McCandless:</b> Roger. At 60 hours and 20 minutes, you have em O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge
and a waste water dump listed. We want to move those up to 59 hours and 50
minutes. That's 59 plus 50.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>051:06:45 McCandless:</b> You still with me, Stu?<p>

<b>051:06:47 Roosa:</b> Okay, Bruce, I moved the fuel cell purge. Yes, I was just [Garbled] making
- getting it all in here, Bruce. Moved the fuel cell purge and the waste water dump to 59:50.<p>

<b>051:06:56 McCandless:</b> Roger. Delete midcourse correction number 3. Over.<p>

<b>051:07:05 Roosa:</b> Jolly good. We'll strike out midcourse 3.<p>

<b>051:07:09 McCandless:</b> Okay. Now, everything scheduled between the times of 60 plus 55 and
64 plus 10 should be scheduled 1 hour earlier. And if you look at 64 plus 10, the breakpoint there
comes after the Verb 48, and we're going to have a write-in that says establish <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> at 63:10, and
LiOH canister change comes at the nominal 64:12. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:07:50 Roosa:</b> Okay. Let me ...<p>

<b>051:07:53 McCandless:</b> Well ...<p>

<b>051:07:54 Roosa:</b> ... read this one again, then. Everything from 61 hours to 64:10 is moved
up an hour. Is that affirmative?<p>

<b>051:08:03 McCandless:</b> Roger. Starting with the prepared transfer items per <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> Activation
Checklist and all that stuff.<p>

<b>051:08:11 Roosa:</b> Okay, we'll move that up 1 hour. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:08:44 Roosa:</b> Okay. I've got that. Everything from 61 to 64:10, move up an hour.<p>

<b>051:08:50 McCandless:</b> Roger. Stand by a second. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:09:22 McCandless:</b> Roger, Stu. At the time of 63:10, following the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> housekeeping
activities, reestablish <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a>. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:09:50 Roosa:</b> Okay, we go to <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> at 63:10.<p>

<b>051:09:54 McCandless:</b> And perform the lithium hydroxide canister change at the nominal
currently scheduled time of 64:12, and pick up the normal flight plan timing
in sequence afterwards. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:10:23 Roosa:</b> Okay. We'll change the canister at 64:12 on time and
then be back on the flight plan.<p>

<b>051:10:32 McCandless:</b> Roger. And I have a 51-hour consumables update for you, if you're
ready to copy back at 51 hours.<p>

<b>051:10:41 Roosa:</b> Stand by 1. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:10:58 Roosa:</b> Okay, let her rip, Bruce.<p>

<b>051:11:07 McCandless:</b> How do you read me, Stu? I think we're in the
process of changing antennas.<p>

<b>051:11:12 Roosa:</b> I read you 5 square. I'm ready to copy.<p>

<b>051:11:15 McCandless:</b> Okay. <a href="acron.html#get">GET</a> of 51 hours even; <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> total, 84 percent; Alfa, 84; Bravo,
83; Charlie, 84; Delta, 84; H<sub>2</sub> tank 1, 79.3, 79.7; O<sub>2</sub> tanks, 92, 91, 45. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:11:56 Roosa:</b> Okay, got you at 51 hours; total, 84; Alfa, 84; Bravo, 83; Charlie, 84;
Dog, 84; H<sub>2</sub>, 79.3, 79.7; O<sub>2</sub>, 92, 91, and 45. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:12:15 McCandless:</b> Roger. And you may be interested in knowing that at the present time
you are only 20 pounds of <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> fuel below the nominal; so, you're really gaining on it there.

<font color=#000060>
<blockquote>
[Two days ago, right after their docking difficulties, they were 62 pounds below nominal on <a href="acron.html#rcs"><font color=#202060>RCS</font></a> fuel.]</blockquote>

</font>
<b>051:12:28 Roosa:</b> I'm sorry, Bruce. You - you busted up; would you start over again, please?<p>

<b>051:12:36 McCandless:</b> Roger. With respect to total <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> fuel, you are only 20 pounds below
the planned <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> budget at the present time, and you are 2 ...<p>

<b>051:12:49 Roosa:</b> Okay. That's broken up pretty badly. I can read we are
20 pounds below nominal.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>051:14:17 McCandless:</b> Okay, Stu, how do you read now?<p>

<b>051:14:20 Roosa:</b> Okay. I'm back with you, and I copied the 20 pounds.<p>

<b>051:14:24 McCandless:</b> Roger. And that's really closing in on the nominal there. A couple of
other items that came up while you were asleep is that we're going to go ahead and exit <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> for
the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> housekeeping, since we want to have the TV up for it. And - we'll just go ahead and dump
the waste water, anyway; or, wait a minute - wait a minute, I'll run that by again. We need to
dump the waste water, which will ruin <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a>; consequently, we're going to come out of <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> for the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>
housekeeping and have a good TV attitude to boot. One item is that I believe you went to sleep
with 16:20 showing on the <a href="acron.html#dsky">DSKY</a>, which was continuously updating during your sleep period; and
unless you have strong feelings otherwise, we would rather have a blank display up on the <a href="acron.html#dsky">DSKY</a> to
keep from cycling the little read [reed?] switches all the time. And another flight plan item, at
55 hours even or thereabouts, we intend to request another set of photographs of the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> from
you using the data acquisition camera and the sextant. We'll have an updated
Noun 88 for you later on. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:15:48 Roosa:</b> Okay, and say that time again, Bruce.<p>

<b>051:15:51 McCandless:</b> Roger; 55 plus 00. Over.<p>

<b>051:15:57 Roosa:</b> Okay, and we'll blank the <a href="acron.html#dsky">DSKY</a>.<p>

<b>051:16:02 McCandless:</b> Okay. No need to blank it now ...<p>

<b>051:16:04 Roosa:</b> For sleep that is.<p>

<b>051:16:05 McCandless:</b> Roger.<p>

<b>051:16:06 Roosa:</b> No, I understand. For sleep - for sleep we'll put it to rest.<p>

<b>051:16:10 McCandless:</b> Roger, Roger. And when you all get your breakfast well prepared and
you're feeling in a jovial mood up there, why, we'll proceed with the Bruce
and Bo show on the morning news. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:16:29 Roosa:</b> Okay, hang on till we all get tuned in. We sure wouldn't want to miss that.<p>

<b>051:16:35 McCandless:</b> It'll be a couple of minutes yet. We just got the
paper here, and we're editing it right now.<p>

<b>051:16:43 Roosa:</b> Okay. [Garbled] IVB, Bruce; I was thinking about that what you - I could
see through the sextant. You know, I had two - it looked like two dim stars in the - in the
sextant at that pointing attitude. And, I didn't see any tumbling motion at all on either one of
them. And they were separated probably by - roughly half to three-quarters of a degree; I'd say
0.5 to 0.6 of a degree separation between the two, but I really couldn't see anything that would
determine whether I was looking at the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> or a star, a faint star. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:17:36 McCandless:</b> Roger. We copy, Stu ...<p>

<b>051:17:38 Roosa:</b> I really expected the - I guess I really expected the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> to be a little
brighter than either one of the two objects that I looked at.<p>

<b>051:17:53 McCandless:</b> Okay, stand by a second, please,

<b>051:19:26 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston, Stu.<p>

<b>051:19:32 McCandless:</b> Yes. We've just received the intelligence down here that your family
is having lasagna for your breakfast. Over.<p>

<b>051:19:42 Roosa:</b> Oh, man; that's - that's good timing.<p>

<b>051:19:45 McCandless:</b> We thought you'd enjoy hearing about it.<p>

<b>051:19:55 Roosa:</b> There's nothing better for breakfast than lasagna,
unless it's a sausage-onion sandwich.<p>

<b>051:20:02 McCandless:</b> (Laugh) Very good.<blockquote>[Very long comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>051:38:26 Mitchell:</b> Houston. Apollo 14.<p>

<b>051:38:30 McCandless:</b> Go ahead, 14.<p>

<b>051:38:35 Mitchell:</b> Roger, Bruce. I have a few observations about the light flash
experiment that I'd like to pass on, and perhaps you can generate some
information from it that might be useful to us.<p>

<b>051:38:49 McCandless:</b> Would you stand by a minute, please, Ed.<p>

<b>051:38:53 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Standing by. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:39:50 McCandless:</b> Apollo 14, this is Houston. Ed, go ahead with your commentary on the
cosmic ray light flashes, and we'll digest what you've got and give you our
views back probably in a couple of hours. Over.<p>

<b>051:40:05 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Bruce. First of all, let me say we all decided to try to
dark-adapt, and run the experiment, or at least part of it, last night. I think our experience was
that we probably saw one flash after dark-adapting and promptly fell asleep before we saw any
more. At least that's true in my case. I think Al and Stu stayed awake a bit longer. However, I
think we have seen only three types of flashes so far. What we would probably call a star, a
supernova, and a flash - or rather and a streak - and I think that I have seen some - I for -
don't recall a name we tagged to them, but reminiscent of the lightning flashing in - in behind
the clouds. Those are the only ones that we have really identified, and it takes awhile to realize
what you are seeing, because it happens so Quickly that it takes a little bit of practice before
you can really recognize these things. I think perhaps after watching them for another period or
so, we will be a little more experienced at it and be able to do a more creditable job of
dark-adapting and getting the sort of data that would be liked. My experience is that even the
so-called star, the supernova, are not as clean a phenomena, or clear a picture, as I had in my
mind that they would appear. There still - still seem to be at least two flashes; maybe a bright
flash, followed an instant later by a more subdued flash, or perhaps a halo-like effect. It
doesn't seem to be - there does not seem to be a set pattern in each case. Sometimes it's a very
clear single flash. Sometimes it seems followed by a halo; sometimes it seems followed by an
adjacent flash. I guess that's about all I have to say at the moment.

<b>051:42:28 McCandless:</b> Roger, Ed. I think we've copied all of that [Garbled.]<p>

<b>051:42:29 Roosa:</b> I'd like to add a few ... I'd like to add a few
comments on that too, Bruce.<p>

<b>051:42:37 McCandless:</b> Go ahead.<p>

<b>051:42:41 Roosa:</b> Hey, Bruce. Do you read?<p>

<b>051:42:42 McCandless:</b> Roger, 14. Go.<p>

<b>051:42:46 Roosa:</b> Okay, Bruce. I'd like to make - You know, you asked yesterday about
whether we saw them before we were dark-adapted. So, last night I took my flashlight and shined it
in both of my eyes; and, of course, you know, that should ruin your - dark-adaption that you would
have. And in fact, you know, you got the - the residual glow in your eye for a minute and then
closed them and, in one case, less than a minute, I had started seeing the flashes. And on the
second time around, I'd say it's probably around 2 minutes before I started picking them up. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:43:30 McCandless:</b> Okay, Stu. And were you seeing - when you started seeing them, did
you see a number of flashes? Ed reported, I think he saw just about one before he fell asleep.<p>

<b>051:43:40 Roosa:</b> Well, what we did was we set the timer on 20 minutes, and I heard the
timer go off and by that time I had only seen four or five flashes that I could recall. However,
at some other periods during the night - That isn't when I did the flashlight routine; that was
later on - more toward this morning when I started playing with the flashlight - and I - in one
case, I saw one and then followed not too long after that by four or five and then - haven't
really picked up any pattern on that. You may see one and then three or four, and you may see one
and wait awhile. I can't really - it's a little difficult to time in the dark, you know, and get a
feel; and, as far as the types of them ... [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:44:32 McCandless:</b> Okay. We're switching antennas, Stu.<p>

<b>051:44:34 Roosa:</b> Three types. However, my super - supernova, there's explosions in one, and
very rare; I'll see a - a - a discrete pinpoint of light for a minute, and then the streaks I've
noticed are all - what I would consider over at the periphery of my - of my vision. It - it
appears that almost all the streaks are right along the edge of my eye, and I get the - get the
impression that the majority of these are running, say longitudinal with the axis of my body. And
it seems rare that I see a streak that's right - right in the center of my vision. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:45:29 Mitchell:</b> This is Ed. I'm - I have had a little different experience than Stu
has. I don't think that I have seen quite as many streaks as he seems to. But I have seen some
that appear to be going from right to left, near the center of the field of vision. However, I
have mostly been concentrating on trying to identify the types, as opposed to locating them and
getting their frequency. I did observe one right after we started to dark-adapt, about 20 seconds.
But nothing after that. And, as I say, I think I fell asleep sometime within a
couple of minutes after that. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:46:15 McCandless:</b> Do we have any observations from the Commander?<p>

<b>051:46:22 Mitchell:</b> No. He's busy cooking breakfast right now.<p>

<b>051:46:24 McCandless:</b> Oh, Roger. And I guess we just went through an antenna switchover;
and we've got some news here, if you all ready.<p>

<b>051:46:39 Shepard:</b> I have only one comment. I think the echo of the other - on the light
flashes. They do seem to be random, sort of a showery-type pattern. They are visible in a darkened
cabin within a very few minutes after turning the lights off - probably as small a time as 1 or 2
minutes. And I've - as far as the characteristics of the flashes are concerned, I've observed
about what the other guys have.<p>

<b>051:47:06 McCandless:</b> Roger. We copy, Al. [Long pause]<p>

fish cakes show mercury content well below the danger level. The FDA said Monday, 'More than 80
samples contained an average mercury level of 0.06 parts per million. Under FDA guidelines, fish
with a half part per million is withdrawn from the market.' " [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:49:22 Bobko:</b> "The chill blast of a February norther blew into Texas Monday, dropping
the temperature sharply after the summer-like weather which closed out last week. January's last
day saw temperatures in the 90's in several points in deep-south Texas. And it was one of the
driest months ever back here in Houston - in Texas. The Dallas weather station, for example,
measured 0.16 - that's 16/100ths - of an inch of rain against the normal 2.32 inches for January." [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:50:00 Bobko:</b> "The Rarest Atom Particle Reported Found," New York, Associated Press.
"Physicists from the University of California reported Monday, they have discovered the rarest and
the most elusive of the nuclear particles within the atom. They found the particle's track in a
photograph of a nuclear interaction, an inch-long footprint it left during its brief lifetime of
15 billionths of a second. The particle is called the antiomegaminus baryon part - antiparticle,
the mirror image of matter as we know it on Earth. The discovery is related to the idea that
somewhere out there in space there are galaxies made up of antimatter, Just as galaxies or star
clusters, such as the one we live in, the Milky Way, is made up of matter." [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:51:34 Roosa:</b> Aw, let it get away, Bruce.<p>

<b>051:51:38 Mitchell:</b> Hey, that's a pretty great piece of news.<p>

<b>051:51:40 Bobko:</b> Okay. "On Wall Street, investors bought heavily on Monday giving the
Dow-Jones Industrial Average its highest single-day gain of the year. The Dow-Jones average of 30
industrial stocks closed up at 877.81, up 9.31 points, for the biggest one-day jump in '71.
Trading was heavy throughout the session, with the New York Stock Exchange ticker backed up a
minute or more several times during the day. The tape was 3 minutes late at the close." [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:52:19 Bobko:</b> Washington, UPI. "The administration is considering a pollution tax, such
as a levy on emissions of air-polluting sulphur dioxides, in an effort to give industry an
incentive to clean up, President Nixon's Economic Report said Monday. The report, prepared by the
President's council of economic advisors and sent to Congress under Mr. Nixon's signature, said a
tax may be a more effective way to control pollution than direct Government regulation." [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:52:52 Bobko:</b> "At 9:03 tonight, the Apollo 14 crew will begin operating under NASA's own
version of daylight savings time. The readjustment of the mission clocks will bring the flight
back to the actual real time - parentheses - Greenwich mean time - parentheses - for activities as
scheduled in the flight plan. At 9:03 p.m., the flight will be 54 hours into the mission. However,
under the nominal flight plan, the 54-hour mark should have been reached at 8:23. To correct this,
the crew will move their mission elapsed time clock ahead 40 minutes to
coincide with the real-time clock." [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:53:37 Bobko:</b> This is by Francis Dobbs, Austin. "A bill creating an upper level college
at Clear Lake as a branch of the University of Houston has been approved by the Senate Education
Committee. The bill, introduced by Senator Chat Brooks of Pasadena, will create the University of
Houston Clear Lake Campus primarily to serve six area junior colleges. A proposed 360-acre campus
is adjacent to the Manned Spacecraft Center. The proposed college must be started immediately,
Hoffman said, for two reasons. To be of service to San Jacinto Junior College, Alvin Junior
College, Brazosport Junior College, Lee Junior College, College of the Mainland, and Galveston
Community College and to help limit enrollment at the University of Houston's main campus to
30,000." And then on later it says that the University of Houston Clear Lake would accept students
with 56 or more semester hours and would offer degrees to the master's level. [Long pause]<p>

<b>051:54:38 Mitchell:</b> That's pretty interesting news.<p>

<b>051:54:39 Roosa:</b> Yes.<p>

<b>051:54:40 Bobko:</b> Rochester, New York. "Brooks Robinson, outstanding player in the World's

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 52 hours
47 minutes. Flight dynamics officer, Dave Reed has just
completed briefing the flight controllers here in the
control center on the procedures that will be followed and
the rational for the clock update, which is scheduled to
occur at about 54 hours 45 minutes, at which time the
clocks in the computer complex here will be reset ahead
40 minutes and essentially placing us back on the flight
plan, both in terms of ground elapsed time and in terms of
central standard time. One of the finer points being
considered at the moment is whether to update precisely
40 minutes, or to update 40 minutes and 3 seconds, which
is in fact the exact amount of time that was made up in
the maneuver. In other words the point at which the
spacecraft crosses the 180 degree meridian, if we update
40 minutes and 3 seconds we will be precisely on the <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a>
at which that event will occur, and at the present time
the vote here in the control center as to whether to update
40:03 or 40:00 stands at 1 to nothing in favor of 40:03, and
we'll let you know how the polling progresses. For the most
part no one seems to have too much of an opinion. The
reaction seems to be about the same as the reaction that
came in from the post flight evaluation team which is going
to have to sort out all of these numbers and make everything
agree and see that nothing gets confused, and that reaction
was something to the effect of, if you have to update, do
it any way you see fit. One point that Dave Reed made, was
that precautions will be taken to see that, in addition to
keeping people from getting confused by the update, to see
that the computers are also not confused by the update.
In describing the rationale for the update, we mentioned
that the booster, the saturn 3rd stage , the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> is targeted
to place the spacecraft at the moon at the proper sun time
regardless of the time that it lifts off from earth. Recognizing
then that the lift off time was 40 minutes late, the
booster guidance system targeted a trajectory which was
some what flatter, which arrived at the moon approximately
40 minutes earlier than it otherwise would have, and we're
now in the process through this flight plan update, through
<a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> update rather, of making the clock and the flight plan
once again agree, and as I mentioned, once the update is
carried out, the <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> time on the clock here in mission control
will once again agree with the flight
plan and the times that are in the flight plan reference
to central standard time, will also be back in synch with
the current central standard time."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 53 hours,
58 minutes. We're now just about 45 minutes away from the
scheduled updating of the clocks here in Mission Control.
The flight plan calls for the <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> update to occur at about
54 hours, 45 minutes. However, the precise timing of it
is not critical. And it will more than likely be done at
some point when we're in communication with the crew and
when the timing is right as far as making the changes in
the real time computer clock complex. The flight dynamics
officer has come up with a new set of coordinates for the
predicted <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> impact on the moon. They are as follows:
8.4 degrees south and 25.9 degrees west, and the predicted
ground elapsed time of impact is 82 hours, 37 minutes,
42 seconds. And of course that <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> time will be updated
by approximately 40 minutes. You'll be able to add about
40 minutes to that time to get the post update ground
elapsed time of impact. The update will be 40 minutes and
3 seconds. The straw vote that was taken in the control
center turned out one to nothing in favor of 40 hours -
40 minutes, 3 seconds as opposed to 40 minutes, 00 seconds.
The retro-fire officer was the only one voting and it
was his preference that we do the update 40 minutes, 03 seconds,
which puts the flight plan precisely in synchronization
with Greenwich Mean Time at that time. The things that were
considered in making that choice - updating by 40 minutes
and 3 seconds as opposed to 40 minutes and 0 seconds, in
the one case, it makes the flight plan and the ground elapsed
time perfectly in synchronization with no seconds left over.
However, in updating 40 minutes and 3 seconds as opposed to
40 minutes and 0 seconds it complicated computing back to
get the real ground elapsed time. The difference, of course,
relatively minor and since the only one who really seemed
to have a preference was the retro-fire officer, flight
director Milton Windler decided to yield to that preference
and we'll update by 40 minutes and 03 seconds adding that
amount of time to the current ground elapsed time. I would
like to repeat also an announcement that was made earlier
and that is that the television scheduled for the next
shift at 4:08 central standard time has been moved up one
hour. This was done because of the deletion of the midcourse
correction of mid-course correction 3 opportunity.
That maneuver is not needed and will not be performed in
order to keep the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> housekeeping activities all on the same
shift. The flight plan was in effect condensed - everything
moved up an hour and the television which is associated with
the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> housekeeping was also moved up, so that the current
schedule for the TV is at 3:08 a.m. tomorrow morning. At the
present time we show Apollo 14 traveling at velocity of
2,906 feet per second [886 m/s] and the altitude is 166,487 nautical
miles [308,334 km]."<p>

situation. Probably the most significant ...<p>

<b>055:46:52 Shepard:</b> Go ahead.<p>

<b>055:46:53 McCandless:</b> ... Probably the most significant part of the whole discussion is
that both values of T<sub>ephem</sub> are correct, and the way that they arrive at this is as follows. The
left-hand-most digit of the octal representation of T<sub>ephem</sub> is coded to include a sign. If you
break the left-hand-most digit down into the 3 binary bits, the first bit being zero represents
positive. The first bit being a one represents negative. In the value of T<sub>ephem</sub> update on the
pad, you'll notice that in the R<sub>3</sub> load it was 16020 which is a positive 16020. In the value that
you read out of the command module computer, you will notice that R<sub>2</sub> was one least significant
digit larger than the pad value, that is, 35224. An R<sub>3</sub> having the left-hand-most digit of 5 was,
in reality, equal to a minus 16017, which is then subtracted from the one-digit-larger value of
R<sub>2</sub>. Does that make sense to you all? Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>055:48:29 Shepard:</b> Affirmative. In other words, you want us to leave the loads the same.<p>

<b>055:48:31 McCandless:</b> Roger. Either load is correct. The command module computer does not
force a positive sign or a negative sign on the octal value but accepts whatever it happens to
come up with. So either load is correct. Over.<p>

<b>055:48:49 Shepard:</b> Okay. Assuming we have no more updates, how would you like us to update
the T<sub>ephem</sub> into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> - Using the 1706 values? [Long pause]<p>

<b>058:14:31 Haise:</b> Okay. There's a request from down here to run through a little four-step
exercise in having Al check his electrode leads and see if we can find anything early here, so we
got time to do something about it before you'll get around to the suiting up part of it. And I
guess that's at Al's convenience in the next few hours, whenever he thinks he
can work it in, maybe. [Long pause]<p>

<b>058:15:10 Mitchell:</b> Okeydoke. We're finishing up lunch right now. Let Al think it over and

<b>058:43:13 Shepard:</b> Houston, 14.<p>

<b>058:43:20 Haise:</b> Okay, 14, stand by 1 until I get a little better comm.
I - I can hardly read you now.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>058:44:31 Haise:</b> 14, Houston. How do you read now?<p>

<b>058:44:37 Shepard:</b> Okay, read you loud and clear. This is Al. I understand you - you're
still having a problem with my sensors.<p>

<b>058:44:45 Haise:</b> Negative, Al. The situation is - you did have the problem for launch, and
then it mysteriously went away. And what they'd like is a visual inspection of the gear to see if
we have anything that looks abnormal that we might think about fixing at this time, rather than
wait until just before suit-up time, where we'd like to not fiddle with anything. [Long pause]<p>

<b>058:45:20 Shepard:</b> I have - I've checked all the sensors, Fredo. They all seem to be firmly
in place. They don't appear to have moved. I did have some garble in the gober cable at one time,
and that has been changed and now you can compare gober cables. That might have made the
difference. I can switch back to that and take a check on that one if you want to.<p>

<b>058:45:42 Haise:</b> No, that - I don't think that's necessary. I might just tell you what they
had in mind here and see if you - kind of covered all of the - the places they wanted you to
check. Around each of the electrodes, they wanted to know if you had any of the paste that
appeared to leak out that you could see stain under the large round pieces of tape you got over
them, was the first item. Then, another inspection thing was to look at the solder joints, that's
the areas that had the little plastic sleeves over them, to see if you could see anything that
appeared to be cracked or coming loose in there. And I guess the last inspection item was the - in
your biobelt to check that the top and bottom connectors on the blue - the little blue EKG signal
conditioner was all tight. [Long pause]<p>

<b>058:46:51 Shepard:</b> Okay. We have one that appears to have leaked a
little bit. It's the bottom one on the sternum.<p>

<b>058:47:00 Haise:</b> Okay, the bottom one on the sternum. Okay, and I guess the only other
square, which should be pretty easy to fill here, Al - he's looking at your data now - is to
sequentially put some firm pressure on each of the three sensors for about 10 seconds, giving a
call down when you're applying the pressure. [Long pause]<p>

<b>058:47:34 Shepard:</b> Okay. Understand you're ready now?<p>

<b>058:47:38 Haise:</b> That's affirm. They're looking at your data now.<p>

<b>058:47:44 Shepard:</b> Okay, in the top section of the sternum, I am pressing down the one
closest to the right shoulder, now.<p>

<b>058:47:50 Haise:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>058:47:53 Shepard:</b> And I'm releasing on that one, now.<p>

<b>058:47:57 Haise:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>058:47:58 Shepard:</b> On the top of the sternum, I'm pressing down the center one, now.<p>

<b>058:48:02 Haise:</b> Roger, Al.<p>

<b>058:48:05 Shepard:</b> And releasing now.<p>

<b>058:48:06 Haise:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>058:48:07 Shepard:</b> Okay. And the bottom - on the bottom of the sternum, the one who appears
to have leaked a little bit, I'm pressing down, now.<p>

<b>058:48:18 Haise:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>058:48:20 Shepard:</b> And releasing, now.<p>

<b>058:48:23 Haise:</b> Roger.<p>

with the present harness and cable configuration.<p>

<b>058:49:52 Haise:</b> Yes. For the time being that - that's the word, Al. But they're going to
look at the data. I guess the bottom one you pushed on showed more change than the others, and I -
they're going to look at it awhile and decide if they want to do anything
about that bottom one, I guess.<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, 59 hours 10
minutes ground elapsed time. Most recent conversation very
brief exchange some moments ago about some spurious signals
or at any rate some problems with one of the sensors on
spacecraft commander Shephards' medical harness. And they
wanted to get the problem sorted out prior to the time the
crew suited up for the lunar landing. Apparently it's just
some looseness in the sensor and the surgeon is toying with
the idea of perhaps having him put some additional paste
underneath the sensor and another piece of tape. This will
be resolved at some later time. Here in the control room,
the spacecraft communicators are having a separate handover
from the rest of the flight control team. Apollo 14 backup
lunar module pilot, Joe Engle is placing Fred haise at the
Capcoms' console. Apollo 14 now 173 754 nautical miles [321,792 km] out

<b>059:30:09 Haise:</b> Roger, Al.

<blockquote>[Long comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>059:38:45 Haise:</b> Apollo 14, Houston.<p>

<b>059:38:51 Shepard:</b> Go ahead, Houston.<p>

<b>059:38:52 Haise:</b> Okay, Al. First, we got some words for you on the - replacing this lower
ECG sensor, and it'll be just taking it off and cleaning it and replacing the same one. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:39:11 Shepard:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>059:39:12 Haise:</b> Okay. The materials that you're going to be needing are all in the medical
kit over in R-8, and what you'll need is one of those large pieces of tape and one of the rings -
rings that fit on the sensor. And the paste that's in the plastic bottle. And
all these are in the kit.<p>

<b>059:39:35 Shepard:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>059:39:38 Haise:</b> Okay. And you can do this at your convenience, Al. There are just a couple
of things that we wanted to make sure you get cautioned on. I'll go ahead and go through the
procedures here and if there's anything that you want gone over again, well, just holler. First,
remove the tape and the sensor, and clean your skin with one of the wet wipes. And then wipe the
paste from the inside of the sensor. Wipe the sensor itself out first, and then pull off the old
piece of tape. That's that double stickyback. It looks like that round, double stickyback Scotch
tape. Pull that off after you've cleaned the sensor out. Then take the new ring, and pull off one
of - one of the pieces of cardboard on the ring, and put it on and leave the other side covered.
Then put the - then put the paste in the sensor. And after you've got the paste in there level,
pull the other side off so that its stickyback is showing and put it back on
your - put it back on your skin then. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:40:54 Shepard:</b> Okay. I understand. I'll give you a call if I have
any questions. That sounds pretty good.<p>

<b>059:40:59 Haise:</b> Okay. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:41:17 Haise:</b> 14, Houston.<p>

<b>059:41:22 Mitchell:</b> Go ahead.<p>

<b>059:41:23 Haise:</b> Okay. We'd like you to put off doing the water dump. In a little bit here,
I'll have the flightplan update with some instructions to shoot some pictures
when we have you do that.<p>

<b>059:41:41 Mitchell:</b> Okay. You caught me just in time. I was on my way to the dump valve now.<p>

<b>059:41:45 Haise:</b> Read your mind, Ed. Which dump was that? ...<p>

<b>059:41:50 Roosa:</b> Okay. Did you get the torquing angles, Houston?<p>

<b>059:41:54 Haise:</b> We got them.<p>

<b>059:41:58 Mitchell:</b> Okay. I trust you're going to put if off until after we've finished
with the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> and the TV show, et cetera. Is that right, Fredo?<p>

<b>059:42:05 Haise:</b> Yes. I think the pictures they're wanting are from the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> side.<p>

<b>059:42:12 Mitchell:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>059:42:17 Roosa:</b> And Fred, the time on that torquing was 59:41:10.<p>

<b>059:42:24 Haise:</b> Okay. 59:41:10.<p>

<b>059:42:28 Roosa:</b> Roger.

<b>059:49:54 Haise:</b> 14 to Houston.<p>

<b>059:49:58 Mitchell:</b> Go ahead.<p>

<b>059:50:00 Haise:</b> Hey, I got a flight-plan update for you here and a whole bunch of words on
shooting the water from the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>.<p>

<b>059:50:13 Roosa:</b> Okay, go ahead. I'm ready for the flight-plan update.<p>

<b>059:50:16 Haise:</b> Okay. At 60 hours and 40 minutes where you've maneuvered a TV attitude, we
need to change the roll angle to 069; and as a result of that, we also change the High Gain angles
to minus 66, Pitch; and Yaw, 105. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:50:53 Roosa:</b> Okay, Fred. I got the High Gain angles of a minus 66
and 105; and say the new attitude for TV.<p>

<b>059:51:03 Haise:</b> Okay, it's - the only thing changed is the roll angle
to 069, so it will be 069, 090, 000.<p>

<b>059:51:15 Roosa:</b> 069, 090, 000; minus 66, 105.<p>

<b>059:51:22 Haise:</b> Okay. Now - now some words on the water dump. Like to delay the waste
water dump to 62 hours and 30 minutes rather than the 59:50 that it had previously been set at. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:51:47 Roosa:</b> Okay, I got it. Waste water dump at 62:30, and say after that.<p>

<b>059:51:52 Haise:</b> Okay, the after that was just a scratch out the 59:50
you had before. Now some words on the ...<p>

<b>059:52:01 Roosa:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>059:52:02 Haise:</b> ... on the camera operation. Al and Ed should take over to the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> with
them magazine F out of the B-8 cushion and borrow your 18-millimeter lens out
of the command module. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:52:32 Roosa:</b> Okay, and they'll take magazine F out of B-8 and I guess I'll let them
borrow my 18 millimeter to take in the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>.<p>

<b>059:52:41 Haise:</b> Okay, just might make sure they give it back to you. But when they get it
over there they can stick it on the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> deck and ...<p>

<b>059:52:50 Roosa:</b> They'll have to sign a receipt.<p>

<b>059:52:53 Haise:</b> ... Yes. And put the following settings required on the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> deck. f/8,
1/250th, 11 feet, and 24 frames a second. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:53:16 Roosa:</b> Okay, put the 18 millimeter on the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> deck and set her up f/8, 1/250th, 11
feet, and 24 frames per second.<p>

<b>059:53:25 Haise:</b> Okay. And to run the camera, of course, they're going to need the Sequence
Camera circuit breaker closed, and that actually fits in pretty well if they just do all this
business right where that's called out on page 116, step 9, of the Activation List. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:53:57 Roosa:</b> Okay. They'll need the Sequence Camera circuit breaker
in and we're talking about page 116, step 9.<p>

<b>059:54:06 Haise:</b> Roger. And if that doesn't quite aline with the flight-plan time I give
you, that 62:30, it isn't going to matter that much anyway.<p>

<b>059:54:17 Roosa:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>059:54:18 Haise:</b> Okay. Now they need a cue from you, Stu, to let them know when you're
going to start the dump. And what they'd like them to do is have the camera pointing through the
docking window of the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>, the upper window, right at the vent and run it 20
seconds' worth at 24 frames. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:54:51 Roosa:</b> Okay. They'll boresight on the vent and run her 20 seconds at 24 frames.<p>

<b>059:54:57 Haise:</b> Okay, then they'd like to change the frame rate to one
and run the camera for another 20 seconds. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:55:18 Roosa:</b> Okay. Change to one frame per second and run 20 seconds.<p>

<b>059:55:24 Haise:</b> Okay. After that chore, they can rest a while and wait until you get down
to the end of the water dump, Stu, and you can kind of give them the word when you're ready to
shut her off. And then they'd like them to shoot the vent again at 24 frames a
second for 10 seconds. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:56:06 Roosa:</b> [Garbled] vent [Garbled.]<p>

<b>059:56:13 Haise:</b> Stand by 1, Stu, we got pretty bad comm now.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>059:57:40 Haise:</b> And, Stu, how do you read me now?<p>

<b>059:57:45 Roosa:</b> Loud and clear, Fred.<p>

<b>059:57:49 Haise:</b> Okay. We left off with them shooting 24 frames for 10
seconds when you turn the valve off.<p>

<b>059:57:59 Roosa:</b> That's affirmative.<p>

<b>059:58:00 Haise:</b> Okay. Then they're to change the frame rate to one frame per second and
run the camera for at least 60 seconds or until cloud particles are no longer visible. But I guess
if neither of those two events happen in that time, they're not to run it
longer than about 180 seconds' worth. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:58:36 Haise:</b> In other words, they're trying - they'd like to get a
picture of the last drop distances. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:58:54 Roosa:</b> Okay. They'll change to one frame per second for at least 60 seconds or
until no vent, and max time will be 180 seconds.<p>

<b>059:59:02 Haise:</b> Yes, that's it. Then the only thing else is, you can frisk them when they
get back and make sure they got your 18-millimeter lens and the Mag F back across, and they should
put the 10 millimeter back on the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> camera.<p>

<b>059:59:21 Roosa:</b> Roger. I'm having Al sign a receipt for the command
module property in here before it leaves.<p>

<b>059:59:27 Haise:</b> Okay. [Long pause]<p>

<b>059:59:48 Haise:</b> And, 14, we're going to have site changeover here
directly. We may lose you for a minute or so.<p>

<b>060:15:36 Roosa:</b> Okay, Fred. I'd like to question you here, since we've had this change in
the flight plan, about going to the Wide Dead Band here. If I do that, then it'll be another
maneuver back to start the <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a>, where if I stay Narrow Dead Band, I could be damping the rates
when I got ready to start the <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a>. Would you smoke that over there and see
what you think about that?<p>

this time around because it'll be too late the next one. So I'm going to go ahead and go in the
Narrow Dead Band. It looks to me like it would be - we'd save gas that way.<p>

<b>060:28:56 Haise:</b> Okay. He was still trying to crank out some numbers to compare there, Stu. [Long pause]<p>

<b>060:29:13 Mitchell:</b> Fredo. You've faded out again. We've lost you.<p>

<b>060:30:31 Roosa:</b> Houston, this is 14. You're loud and clear.<p>

<b>060:30:34 Haise:</b> Okay. The Narrow Dead Band looks like it'll save you a
little gas there, Stu.<p>

<b>060:30:42 Roosa:</b> Okay. I didn't hear back from you so I wanted to catch the roll this time
around. So I went ahead and went Narrow.<p>

<b>060:30:50 Haise:</b> Okay.<p>
