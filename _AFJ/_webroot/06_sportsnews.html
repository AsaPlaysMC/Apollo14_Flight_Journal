<div><b>032:02:47 McCandless:</b> Roger. You're Go for <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> spinup now.</div>
<div><b>032:02:58 Roosa:</b> What would we do without you, Bruce? [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>032:03:17 Roosa:</b> Hey, Bruce. How come we haven't heard any news, like who won at Daytona and things like that?</div>
<div><b>032:03:25 McCandless:</b> Well, we tried for one news summary and most of the news came out to be on the subject of Apollo 14. We figured you guys were probably the ones that had the inside scoop on that, so we'll give a stab at another one.</div>
<div><b>032:03:38 Roosa:</b> Yes. Tell us what's going on at the races at Daytona.</div>
<div><b>032:03:42 McCandless:</b> Okay. Give us a couple of minutes and we'll have some word for you.</div>
<div><b>032:03:48 Roosa:</b> Oh, no sweat. Just at your convenience.
<div class="comment">Very long comm break.</div>
<div><b>032:29:10 McCandless:</b> Apollo 14, this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>032:29:13 Shepard:</b> Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>032:29:21 McCandless:</b> If the workload isn't too heavy up there for you, we've got another set of Noun 88 values for sighting on the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a>, if you're interested.</div>
<div><b>032:29:34 Mitchell:</b> Okay, stand by and I'll copy them down. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>032:30:20 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Houston. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>032:30:23 McCandless:</b> Roger, 14. Noun 88: minus 34293, minus 85901, minus 38013. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>032:30:48 Roosa:</b> Okay, Bruce, you back with us?</div>
<div><b>032:30:49 McCandless:</b> Yes, I'm still with you.</div>
<div><b>032:31:00 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>032:31:05 Roosa:</b> Hello, Houston. How do you read? 14.</div>
<div><b>032:31:08 McCandless:</b> 14, we're approaching an antenna switchover period here. Let me give you a call again in a minute. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>032:31:45 Roosa:</b> Hello, Houston. How do you read, 14?</div>
<div><b>032:31:48 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston. Loud and clear. How me? Over.</div>
<div><b>032:31:52 Roosa:</b> We're back with you. How about giving me R<sub>3</sub> again, please?</div>
<div><b>032:31:56 McCandless:</b> Okay, R<sub>3</sub> is minus 38013. Read back. Over.</div>
<div><b>032:32:04 Roosa:</b> Okay; reading you back from Noun 88: minus 34293, minus 85901, minus 38013.</div>
<div><b>032:32:16 McCandless:</b> Roger; readback correct. These are calculated for a <a href="acron.html#get">GET</a> of 32 hours 45 minutes, but should be valid from the present up to about 33:45. You will be able to see the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> when your spacecraft roll angle is between 85 degrees, that's 085 degrees and 020 degrees.. If you do see it through the sextant, we'd like you to try to take some pictures, using the same techniques as on the dim-light photography per camera advance, same film magazine, same exposure times, if you concur. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>032:33:01 Roosa:</b> Okay, sounds great. I understand this is set up for a time of 32 plus 45:00, however, it ought to be good now and we ought to be able to hack it when our roll is between 085 to 020. And if we lap the big moose, we'll take some pictures of it using the same magazine and the same procedures as the Earth dim light that we just finished. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>032:33:31 McCandless:</b> Roger; Roger..
<div class="comment">Long comm break.</div>
<div><b>032:39:17 McCandless:</b> Hello, 14, this is Houston. Be advised that the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> is tumbling at a rate of one tumble - that is, one 360-degree tumble - about every 4 and a half minutes, so that the intensity of the object may vary if you see it out there. And even if you don't, we've been considering the speed of the film. We'd like to take same pictures. Perhaps it would show up on photography if you can't see it with the naked eye. And another item, your phase plane plot for <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> - It looks like you've established a very good <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> here. It's curving back around toward the center. We think it's going to hold for quite some time. And we'd like to get battery Alfa on Charge at your convenience. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>032:40:13 Roosa:</b> Okay, Bruce; copy that. When we get around to the right roll angle, we'll give a Go on the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a>. Copy about the <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a>, and we'll start a charge.</div>
<div><b>032:40:23 McCandless:</b> Roger.
<div class="comment">Very long comm break.</div>
<div><b>032:54:51 McCandless:</b> Do you see anything out there, Stu?</div>
<div><b>032:54:57 Roosa:</b> Well, we're just now coming out from behind the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>. Looks like I've got something here in the sextant. Let me pull her in the center and see what it looks like. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>032:55:48 Roosa:</b> Well, Bruce, I've got two things in the sextant and - You know, it could either be a faint - faint star - I don't see any - any tumbling on them yet, but 4 and a half minutes isn't that fast either. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>032:56:13 McCandless:</b> Roger. We copy. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>032:56:27 Roosa:</b> Okay, I've lost one of them due to the light coming into the sextant. And I'm about to lose - lose the other object, whatever it was..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>032:58:18 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston. We got a little sports news for you.</div>
<div><b>032:58:26 Roosa:</b> Okay, go ahead. You're just in time for dinner.</div>
<div><b>032:58:31 McCandless:</b> Would you rather I croon something soothing to you, like background music, or Ravel's Bolero or something?</div>
<div><b>032:58:39 Roosa:</b> Negative on the music. We got all that we need here. You can just croon some good sport news.</div>
<div><b>032:58:47 Shepard:</b> Why don't you hold on a minute and let Ed get his headset on?</div>
<div><b>032:58:51 McCandless:</b> (Laughter) It's not that detailed..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>033:00:36 Shepard:</b> Okay, Houston. Everybody's on the line.</div>
<div><b>033:00:39 McCandless:</b> Okay, I don't know if it was really all that earthshaking. I've got the results of the Daytona races. It was won by Pedro Rodriguez from Mexico with his partner Jackie Oliver in a Porsche, and they completed 688 laps of the 3.81-mile course there at Daytona in 24 hours. Ronnie Bucknum and Tony Adamowicz were second in a Ferrari, and Lamak Donohue-David Hobbs team was third. In winning the event, Rodriguez and Oliver averaged over 109 miles per hour for the 24-hour period. And Sunday's Andy Williams - San Diego Open Golf Tournament, Californian George Archer took the honors with a 7-under-par score against his closest competitors, Dave Eichelberger and Jack Nicklaus. Archer ended up with a 65 and $30,000 in prize money. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:01:47 Shepard:</b> Okay, very good. Thank you. Keep up the good news.</div>
<div><b>033:01:50 McCandless:</b> Roger. You can tell Ed to take his headset back off now.
<div class="comment">Very long comm break.</div>
<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 10 minutes. We're at a relatively quite period in the flight plan. The crew is scheduled to begin a rest at about 41 hours ground elapsed time. At the present time we show Apollo 14 124,800 nautical miles [231,130 km] from Earth traveling at a velocity of 4,149 feet per second [1,265 m/s]. The Flight Dynamics Officer reported to the Flight Director a short while ago that tracking seems to be confirming that the midcourse correction maneuver is bringing the spacecraft in a little bit higher above the Moon than had been planned. This would indicate a slight under burn. The predicted point of closest approach at this time is still holding quite close to 37 rather 67 nautical miles [124 km]. The burn had been targeted to bring the spacecraft to within 60 nautical miles [111 km] at its closest approach. This particular burn seems to be - seems to have been quite sensitive to very small velocity errors on the order of about 2/10 foot per second would the <a href="acron.html#fido">FIDO</a> set the count for the difference in the planned altitude and the actual at 7 nautical miles [13 km]. Additional tracking, of course, will probably show some change in that number, but it seems to be holding in quite steadily at about 67 nautical miles [124 km]. The people in the spacecraft engineering support room report that all systems appear to be functioning well at this time aboard the spacecraft. Virtually no problem of any significance, and, as we mentioned earlier, the crew was advised this evening that with the probe at [Garbled] with what we know about the probe at this time, it appears that the mission will be Go for a lunar landing. At 33 hours, 12 minutes, this is Apollo Control standing by."</div>
<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 31 minutes. We've had no conversation with the crew since our last report about 30 minutes ago. At the present time Apollo 14 is 125,649 nautical miles [232,702 km] from Earth, and the spacecraft velocity is 4,121 feet per second [1,256 m/s]. We're preparing for a shift hand over in Mission Control at the present time. And, we do anticipate having a change of shift briefing in the MSC News Center, Probably in about 45 minutes to an hour. Flight Director Jerry Griffin is coming on to relieve Flight Director Milton Windler, and the Capsule communicator on the upcoming shift will be Astronaut Fred Haise. At 33 hours, 32 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston."</div>
<div><b>033:32:36 McCandless:</b> Apollo 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>033:32:40 Shepard:</b> Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>033:32:42 McCandless:</b> Roger. We took up a collection here in the Control Room and bought a newspaper, and we got a couple more items, if you are interested.</div>
<div><b>033:32:51 Shepard:</b> Great. Take up another collection and you might buy two.</div>
<div><b>033:32:56 McCandless:</b> Oh, we'll buy you a morning paper, too, a little later. On the Daytona race, a few more details. Reading into the article Rodriguez and Oliver divided the driving chores up about equally ...</div>
<div><b>033:33:13 Roosa:</b> Bruce, hold up just a second.</div>
<div><b>033:33:19 Roosa:</b> Hold it a second.</div>
<div><b>033:33:20 McCandless:</b> Roger..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>033:34:54 Roosa:</b> Okay, Bruce. [Garbled] Proceed.</div>
<div><b>033:34:57 McCandless:</b> Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:35:45 McCandless:</b> Apollo 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>033:35:48 Roosa:</b> Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>033:35:50 McCandless:</b> Roger. Back in the Daytona, it says that Rodriguez and Oliver divided ... [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:36:20 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston. How do you read now? [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:36:43 McCandless:</b> Apollo 14, Houston. How do you read now?</div>
<div><b>033:36:48 Shepard:</b> Loud and clear, Bruce. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>033:36:50 McCandless:</b> Okay. Let me try it once more with vigor. Back in the Daytona Race, "Rodriguez and Oliver, dividing up the driving chores about equally, had built up a lead of 213 miles at one point in the race. But trouble struck with about 3 hours left when the car's transmission failed as Oliver was motoring around with not a care in the world. Two Ferraris - the one driven alternately by Bucknum and Tony Adamowicz of Wilton, Connecticut, and another under command of two-time U.S. road racing champion Mark Donohue and David Gobbs of England had survived the long night but were out of it as long as the Porsche held together. Oliver brought the powder-blue car into the pit, and he and Rodriguez spent an agonizing 93 minutes watching their lead wiped out as crewmen feverishly made repairs. Bucknum gained the lead 70 minutes from the end and Donohue pulled into striking distance before crew chief John Wyer could get the Porsche rolling again. Rodriguez bolted back to the course a half mile behind Bucknum, whose Ferrari was spitting fire and having trouble getting through the turns. The Mexican hotshot needed less than two laps around the 3.81-mile layout to catch Bucknum and was never in serious trouble again." [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:38:19 Roosa:</b> Damn. That's a good summary, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>033:38:22 McCandless:</b> Yes. I ought to be a sportswriter. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:38:37 Mission Control:</b> Yes. That was very interesting, Bruce. And the next item here is a headline that says "Apollo number 4900 to orbit Earth." [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:38:54 Unknown crew member:</b> (Laughter)</div>
<div><b>033:38:56 Mission Control:</b> "The Aerospace Defense Command has entered Apollo 14 as number 4900 in its records of Earth orbiting satellites. The ADC, housed inside Cheyenne Mountain, is providing NASA with information on satellites passing near Apollo 14 during its Journey to the Moon." Just thought you might be interested in that.</div>
<div><b>033:39:19 Mission Control:</b> Well, they say always better late than ...</div>
<div><b>033:39:22 Roosa:</b> Well, It's Fred-ly! (Laughter)</div>
<div><b>033:39:25 Mission Control:</b> It's better to be number 4900 than not to be at all (laughter). And, meanwhile, today at New York, "The doors of baseball's Hall of Fame swung open for seven oldtimers elected by a veterans' committee after the regular ballot of the Baseball Writers Association of America had failed to name any moderns to the shrine. Legendary pitcher Rube Marquard, who shares the record of 19 consecutive victories in a single season, and George M. Weiss, the executive genius who built the New York Yankees into an awesome powerhouse from the late 1940's, led the advance of the oldtimers. Also named were outfielders Harry Hooper, Joe Kelley, and Chick Hafey, first baseman Jake Beckley, and shortstop Dave Bancroft. Marquard, who won 201 games pitching mostly for the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers from 1908 to 1925; Hooper, who hit .281 in 16 American League seasons; and Kelley and Beckley, both pre-1900 stars, were named as 'real oldtimers' whose careers ended by 1925." [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:40:39 Mission Control:</b> And here's another startling bit of news - from London. The headline says, "Subway riders arrive; can't get out of station." "More than a dozen passengers were trapped in a London subway station for more than an hour early today when the staff locked up and went home." That sound familiar? "When the passengers got off the last train on the Bakerloo line, at the Midavale station in Paddington, they found exits blocked by steel shutters and the station deserted. Police were called and they in turn contacted London subway officials. A spokesman for the London transport said it would investigate the incident. London Subway Service shuts down from about midnight 'til 5 AM." [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:41:36 Mitchell:</b> Could happen to anyone, anyplace.</div>
<div><b>033:41:40 McCandless:</b> Also in the news is this other item from London. That D-day is less than 2 weeks away. They're referring here to the day when England changes to decimalized currency. "A government agency coordinating the switch says everything is going smoothly. 'Our latest survey has shown that since November there has been an incredible improvement in the extent to which people are familiar with the decimal equivalents,' a Decimal Currency Board spokesman said Sunday. On February 15, the new pound, worth $2.40, officially will become worth 100 new pence." [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:42:21 McCandless:</b> And next on the agenda here. "Vehicles are called the top noisemaker." Dateline is from Paris. "Motor vehicles are the chief source of city noise, and only governments can do anything about it. This opinion is the result of a 2-year study by the consultant group on transportation research of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development." Incredible ! (Laughter) "This problem is worldwide." [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:43:02 Mitchell:</b> Seems like you two have a good handle on world events, important world events.</div>
<div><b>033:43:08 McCandless:</b> From Lourenco Marques, Mozambique, this item. "Fresh floodwaters have poured into Portuguese East Africa's cyclone-stricken lowlands today, hampering rescue efforts for thousands of flood victims already marooned 4 days. The central government said 135,000 persons lived in the worst-affected area around Quelimane, administrative capital of the central Zambesia province. Only 24,000 people have been rescued, but Zambesia Governor Lieutenant Gen - Lieutenant Colonel David Ferreira declined to estimate the death toll." Good night, Fred.</div>
<div><b>033:43:45 Mission Control:</b> Very good. Good night, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>033:43:50 Roosa:</b> Tremendous! (Laughter)</div>
<div><b>033:43:57 Shepard:</b> Very nicely done. Very nicely done.</div>
<div><b>033:44:01 McCandless:</b> We had to censor the best parts.</div>
<div><b>033:44:05 Shepard:</b> Say again.</div>
<div><b>033:44:07 McCandless:</b> We had to censor the best parts.</div>
<div><b>033:44:11 Shepard:</b> That's too bad.</div>
<div><b>033:44:18 Shepard:</b> There will be a daily showing, I assume.</div>
<div><b>033:44:23 McCandless:</b> Oh, (laughter), we'll see what we can do..
<div class="comment">Long comm break.</div>
<div><b>033:50:00 Roosa:</b> Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>033:50:05 McCandless:</b> Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>033:50:08 Roosa:</b> Hey, Bruce. I'm going to take some pictures of this <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> area this time around. Do you want me to have the two strips at 24 frames per second for 2 seconds and everything just like on the other sequence?</div>
<div><b>033:50:26 McCandless:</b> That's affirmative, Stu.</div>
<div><b>033:50:30 Roosa:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:50:59 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston. If you feel like doing a little paperwork here, I've got an update to the inflight erasable load procedure as a result of the new <a href="acron.html#pipa">PIPA</a> bias and gyro compensation uplinked to you just prior to midcourse 2. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:51:23 Roosa:</b> Okay, stand by 1, Bruce. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:51:59 Roosa:</b> Okay, Bruce, go ahead.</div>
<div><b>033:52:03 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston. Page 9-4 in the G&C checklist, load A for Albuquerque. Under identification number 03, the old value is 77143; new value, 76674. OID 05: old, 00110; new, 00320; OID 07: old value, 76745; new value, 77417; OID 11: old value, 00477; new value, 006 - make that 00063. Head back. Over..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>033:53:18 Roosa:</b> Okay, under column A, 03, 76674; 05, 00320; 07, 77417; and 11, 00063. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:53:39 McCandless:</b> Roger; readback correct. For cryogenic hydrogen management, we'd like to turn the heater in Hydrogen tank number 2 off, and our calculations show that your pericynthion altitude is currently 67 miles. As the period of our tracking improves, we expect this to work down towards about 60 nautical miles. And we have a question for you. Have you noticed any cosmic ray flashes during your last sleep period or at other times when the command module was darkened? Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>033:54:24 Shepard:</b> One at a time, Houston. You say Hydrogen 2 Heater, Off? Over.</div>
<div><b>033:54:30 McCandless:</b> Roger; H<sub>2</sub> tank number 2 Heater, Off. We'll call you when we want it back to Auto or On.</div>
<div><b>033:54:37 Shepard:</b> Okay, it's Off now. And yea, verily, saw a few flashes. I'm not quite sure what they're ascribed to; but, nevertheless, We saw flashes during the sleep period last night.</div>
<div><b>033:54:51 McCandless:</b> Okay, was this ...</div>
<div><b>033:54:55 Shepard:</b> Unfortunately, we were a little bit - we were a little bit too tired to conduct any sort of measured experimenter data with them, but maybe we will get around to that in the next few days.</div>
<div><b>033:55:08 McCandless:</b> Roger. One question, would you say that you were dark-adapted when you saw these, or did you see them before you were well dark-adapted?</div>
<div><b>033:55:21 Shepard:</b> I will speak for myself. I didn't start seeing them until after I woke up, 3 or 4 hours after going to sleep.</div>
<div><b>033:55:28 Roosa:</b> Hey, Bruce, I had a comment I noticed on that last night. I'd wake up several times and I'd turn on the light to take a look around <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> and that O<sub>2</sub> flow that's been troubling us; and then I'd close my eyes again, and I'd see some flashes real soon after I had been looking at these lights. Now they were rather subdued lights, but you know - I certainly wasn't totally dark-adapted. [Long pause]</div>

<div><b>033:56:12 Roosa:</b> Using the integrals mostly; on several occasions, I did have the floods up to check, and then I'd turn them back off again. And it didn't seem to matter much.</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 34 hours, 23 minutes ground elapsed time. Gold team flight director Jerry Griffin is being briefed by each of the console positions here, each man runs down the items that he has upcoming for this shift. The off going flight director Milton Wendler accompanied by his flight dynamics officer Bill Moon, are en route to the Houston News Center where they will have a change of shift briefing for newsmen in the small auditorium. Apollo 14 very little conversation from the crew in the last several hours is now showing distance from Earth 127,737 nautical miles [236,569 km], velocity 4 051 feet per second [1,235 m/s]. At 34 hours, 24 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control."</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 34 hours, 36 minutes ground elapsed time. We're anticipating no immediate conversation with the rather quite crew of Apollo 14. During the period that the change of shift press conference is under way at the News Center in Houston. The conversations if any will be recorded on tape for subsequent playback. At 34 hours, 36 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control."</div>
<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 35 hours, 5 minutes ground elapsed time. During the change of shift press conference some 3 and 1/2 minutes of air-to-ground conversation was recorded on tape for playback at this time. Presently Apollo 14 is 129,338 nautical miles [239,534 km] out from Earth, traveling at a velocity of just about an even 4,000 feet per second [1,000 m/s]. Some of the major milestones at least from statisticians point of view half way point in time between liftoff and lunar orbit insertion will come at 40 hours, 56 minutes. At which time the spacecraft will be 142,119 miles [263,204 km] from Earth, and 81,723 miles [151,351 km] from the Moon. The anticipated time for crossing the so called equal-gravisphere between Earth and Moon will be 66 hours and 3 minutes and 7 seconds. I believe that tape may be ready now for playback. Let's roll at 3-1/2 minutes and resume live (garbled) air-to-ground."</div>

<div><b>036:12:25 Mitchell:</b> It's been an hour or so, Fred, since I took a look at either back in your direction or at the Moon. Let me see if I can see where you are now. [Long pause]</div>

<div><b>036:14:29 Mitchell:</b> Houston, 14. We have the Moon out the hatch window right now, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>036:14:37 Haise:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>036:14:41 Mitchell:</b> And I presume then that the Earth is probably out the port telescope at this moment.</div>
<div><b>036:14:51 Haise:</b> I guess you'll have to wait about another 20 minutes or so for it to come up in the hatch.</div>
<div><b>036:14:57 Mitchell:</b> Roger. Yes, I suspect also it's down just a little bit too far for us to see.</div>
<div><b>036:15:07 Haise:</b> Let's see, how big a Moon are you seeing there? Is it about not quite a half or something?</div>
<div><b>036:15:16 Mitchell:</b> Roger. It's short of a half; and, for size, it appears about like an orange held at - short of - just short of arm's length. [Garbled] subtends about a degree and a half now, a little less. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>036:15:38 Haise:</b> Roger. And the board here has you at about 135,000 out now. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>036:15:52 Mitchell:</b> Okay, that'll make it slightly over a degree then, I guess. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>036:16:26 Mitchell:</b> As you already know, Fred, the Moon starts to take on a little bit of brown - grayish colors about this point, as opposed to being so very bright as it appears from the Earth. You can start to see a little bit of texture here. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>036:16:48 Haise:</b> Yes, that's a good word to remember, that texture business.</div>

<div><b>036:22:01 Mitchell:</b> Roger.</div>
<div><b>036:22:06 Haise:</b> And, looking at your position, overhead here, you ought to have the Philippines - mainland, the Far East in sight..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>036:23:14 Mitchell:</b> As a matter of fact, I do, Fred. There is quite a bit of cloud cover, and I'm having a little difficulty identifying landmasses. I'll be able to pick it up by the next time around [Garbled.]</div>

<div><b>036:24:51 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Roger. That makes a lot more sense of it; I'm pretty sure I had the Australian Continent down at the bottom of my lighted area, and looking up across the Philippines. And there's a great deal of cloud cover in that area, but there are a few islands standing out. I believe that I can see the southern tip of India standing out without too much cloud on it.

<div><b>036:32:34 Mitchell:</b> Okay, I didn't have [Garbled.]</div>
<div><b>036:32:42 Haise:</b> Say that last again, Ed.</div>
<div><b>036:32:45 Mitchell:</b> I say, I don't have very much viewing time on either the Moon or the Earth. As it swings past the window, it's very low; and I - we don't have - just a few minutes on each window. But it's a most inviting and magnificent view. I'm very glad we have Earth as a Home Planet. I hope we can keep it so it's inviting. [Long pause] 
<div class="comment">The view out of the spacecraft was surprisingly limited, even more so when they are docked with the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>.  It was probably more like a window seat just in front of the wing of a passenger jet than a panoramic view of the vastness of space.</div>
<div><b>036:33:11 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed. Yes, again looking up at the big board I can - need to get about another 40,000 miles or so, then you'll be more directly in the Earth/Moon plane, and you ought to have them pretty much centered in the window about then. [Long pause]</div>

<div><b>036:43:00 Mitchell:</b> Yes. I guess that's what it's all about. The thermal protection - expands from the heat and contracts. And, this is sure doing it on each cycle.</div>
<div><b>036:43:13 Haise:</b> With respect to your weather question awhile ago, Ed, they say they do have a weak cyclonic storm to the west of Australia, but they're not showing anything to the east; and I - maybe I misunderstood, I thought you said you saw it over by the sunset terminator to the east. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>036:43:39 Mitchell:</b> Roger. It appeared to me by the sunset terminator [Garbled] a very - well, like a donut-shaped cloud but several thousand miles across. It might have been too large for just the tropical storm they're talking about. Couldn't be very widespread circulation.</div>
<div><b>036:44:01 Haise:</b> Yes, I guess they need to go look out the window down there, too.</div>

<div><b>039:08:45 Mitchell:</b> I'm listening, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>039:08:47 Haise:</b> Yes. I'm not maybe clear on a question you had earlier about the ball valves with respect to time in the burn on MCC-2, but I do have some data here. And I think the crux of it is - is that if you use a few of the ball valves visually showing full Open to full Closed, you'll be shifting your - what you're actually starting and stopping your clock by about a quarter of a second from the actual chamber pressure. But the total Delta-Time is very close. On that burn, you would have clocked 10.15 versus 10.2 via P<sub>C</sub>. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>039:09:49 Mitchell:</b> Okay. You say had we measured P<sub>C</sub> we would have clocked 10.15. Is that affirm?</div>
<div><b>039:09:57 Haise:</b> No. You'd have - from 90 percent P<sub>C</sub> down to 10 percent, you'd got 10.2 seconds. And if you'd started your watch with Bank A full Open to the Bank A needle showing full Closed, you'd measured 10,15. Except in the time - absolute time scale, you would have started and stopped your watch one quarter second to the right. Because there is a lag in the - what I'm telling you is there ... [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>039:10:30 Mitchell:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>039:10:31 Haise:</b> There's a lag in those needles moving by about a quarter of a second from what the actual chamber pressure is.</div>

Flight surgeon just reported a few moments ago that apparently lunar module pilot Ed Mitchell had unplugged his biomed harness and apparently was preparing to go to sleep. They're somewhat ahead of schedule on this particular item in that the rest period is not scheduled to begin until 41 hours ground elapsed time, which is almost 2 hours from now. One hour from now, I beg your pardon. I don't see how it could be much quieter when they were asleep or awake, Judging from the past several hours sparse conversation. Apollo 14 now 140,147 nautical miles [259,552 km] out from Earth, velocity 3,657 feet per second [1,115 m/s]. An update for <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> impact which was run at 37 hours approximately ground elapsed time shows the impact point at 8 minutes, 52 - as you were 8 degrees, 52 minutes south 25 minutes - 25 degrees, 51 minutes west at a ground elapsed time of 82 hours, 37 minutes, 33 seconds. At 40 hours, 1 minute ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control."</div>

<div><b>040:13:31 Haise:</b> Okay. The <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> is divergent enough that it's not going to make it through the next upcoming sleep period.

<div><b>040:13:48 Shepard:</b> [Garbled] at the moment with the food and everything. We'll probably catch you the next [Garbled] around. [Long pause]</div>

According to flight surgeon Willard Hawkins and here in Mission Control the only one still apparently awake is Commander Shephard aboard Apollo 14 and he apparently is settling down into the easy rhythmic breathing of one going to sleep, but Roosa and Mitchell have apparently been asleep for some time. Apollo 13 - Apollo 14 now 143,114 nautical miles [265,047 km] from Earth. Travelling at a velocity of 3568 feet per second [1,088 m/s].

Lets go."</div>
<div><b>041:32:45 Shepard:</b> Houston, 14. We are ready with our crew status report and with the Verb 74.</div>

<div class="pao">New Capcom referred to is Gordon Fullerton who is replacing Fred Haise at the Capcom's console. Some hand over going on here in the room. Pete Frank being briefed by the out going Flight Director Gerry Griffin, who will be coming to the news center as soon as the hand over is complete for briefing on God only knows what, but at any rate he will be coming over that way.

<div><b>041:39:13 Fullerton:</b> Roger. We're waiting for a good Omni to come up before starting that E-memory dump. One reminder is to complete all dumping before you - try to start the <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> again. And - a question. With respect to the O<sub>2</sub> Flow High alarms you had yesterday and any that you might have had since, we're wondering if you're doing anything - different than normal procedures as far as the - waste management overboard drain or any other - outside drains that control O<sub>2</sub> flow high problem. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>041:39:56 Roosa:</b> That's a negative on the - procedures. We're not doing anything unusual there. And, we haven't had any problems today. The O<sub>2</sub> flow you saw a minute ago was when we were pumping up the cabin to 5 7. And - as far as the ones that - we had yesterday, we really don't have that psyched out.</div>
