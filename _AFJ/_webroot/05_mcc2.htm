<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo control, 16 hours,
57 minutes <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> time. Crew has been asleep now for at least,
that is we haven't heard from them in about the last hour.
The schedule 10 hour sleep period which may run a little bit
longer since they did go to bed earlier. Apollo 14 now 77,595
nautical miles [143,706 km] out from Earth, traveling at a velocity of
6,231 feet per second [1,899 m/s]. The latest status report from the space
craft analysis room in the back of the building here, for
<a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> time of 16 hours, it appears as the earlier report. It
came out all systems normal, no change in status. One
brief mention of the fluctuation and oxygen flow rates, which
occurred shortly before the crew went to sleep, where some of
the waste management valves have apparently had to be recycled
to return the oxygen flow rate to its normal rate of something
around 3/10 of a pound per hour. Battery B in the command
module was taken off charge, at about 13 and 1 half hours <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a>
time. All batteries are topped off now to rated value. Fuel
cells in the service module, fuel cell 1 is hot putting 24 amps
as is number 2 and number 3 is putting out 28 amps. Cryogenic
storage system hydrogen and oxygen in the service module
all showing nominal values of quantity remaining. Fluid temperatures
in the percentage of quantity oxygen tank number 1 is
92.6 per cent remaining, oxygen tank number 2 is 93 per cent,
oxygen tank number 3 is 57 per cent. Number 3 is the tank
that was added after the Apollo 13 incident and of course
the plan is to use from it first and then go to the other
2 tanks. Hydrogen tank number 1 has 90.98 per cent quantity
remaining, Hydrogen tank number 2 89.11 per cent. At 17
hours <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> time the mission of Apollo 14, this is Apollo
Control."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, 17 hours,
57 minutes <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a>. It's been slightly more than 2 hours
since we last heard from the crew of Apollo 14 in the
midst of a sleep period, well deserved. Apollo 14
presently 81,112 nautical miles [150,219 km] out from Earth. Velocity
6,038 feet per second [1,840 m/s]. Rather quiet here in Mission Control
as the Gold Team nears the end of its first shift in this
mission. At 17 hours, 57 minutes <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a>, this is Apollo Control."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, 18 hours, 8 minutes
ground elapsed time. An announcement of local interest here
in manned spacecraft center are newsmen covering Apollo 14,
a briefing on the space shuttle program which had been
scheduled for 9:30 Monday morning, that's today, has been
slipped until 1:30 p.m. in the small briefing room in the
news center. The major participant in this briefing will
be Charles W. Mathews, Deputy Associate Administrator,
Office of Manned Spaceflight, NASA headquarters. To repeat,
this briefing has been rescheduled to 1:30 p.m. today in
the small briefing room, not at 9:30 as previously announced.
Apollo 14, meanwhile, now 81,826 nautical miles [151,542 km] out from
Earth, going in an even 6,000 feet per second [1,829 m/s]. At 18 hours,
9 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, 18 hours,
37 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 14 crew still asleep
at this time. The clock on the front screen of Mission Control,
here, showing an awake time 7 hours, 22 minutes from now. Some
velocity and distance figures: distance out from Earth,
83,399 nautical miles [154,455 km]; velocity 5,917 feet per second [1,804 m/s]. To
recap the past 7 or 7-1/2 hours of the Gold Team tenure here
in Mission Control: The - shortly after the shift of Flight
Controllers under Flight Director, Jerry Griffin came in,
the crew was given a Go to set up the passive thermal control,
the barbecue mode of stabilizing the thermal response of the
spacecraft by rotating about its X-axis. This took a little
while to set up and they had to make two attempts at it.
Roosa asked if it wouldn't be alright to stow the probe, which
had been under examination in the spacecraft back in the tunnel
attached to the drogue and Ron agreed that was the ideal place
to stow it rather than have it rattling around in the cabin.
All attempts onboard the spacecraft and here in Mission Control
with the training model of the probe and drogue to duplicate
the malfunction of the latches failing to engage - all these
attempts failed because it worked every time. The crew
requested that they go to sleep earlier than called for in
the flight plan and they started their sleep period at about
15 hours, 30 minutes ground elapsed time with a brief exchange
of conversation between Stu Roosa and spacecraft communicator,
Fred Haise about 15 minutes afterward. Prior to going to
sleep, there was a brief flurry of high flow rates in the
oxygen system in the spacecraft environmental control system.
It was discovered that it was caused, perhaps, by the valves
in the waste management system bleeding the pressure overboard
and causing higher flow rate in the oxygen system. But this
was corrected without too much difficulty. Passive thermal
control was set up. The crew made their consumables report
of propellants remaining, the amp hours in the batteries,
all the usual standard stuff called for in the flight plan
prior to sleep, and that they did begin their sleep period at
ground elapsed time of 15 hours, 30 minutes. And at 18 hours,
40 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at Houston
at 19 hours, 31 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 14.
Our displays in mission control presently show Apollo 14 at
a distance of 86,406 nautical miles [160,024 km] away from Earth and now
traveling at a speed of 5,765 feet per second [1,757 m/s]. In the
mission control center we're in the process of shift change
over. The Pete Frank team of orange flight controllers replacing
Jerry Griffin, or Jerry Griffins gold team, as has been
previous reported. The Apollo 14 crew is in a rest period.
We now show a wake-up time 6 hours and 28 minutes away. In
the, over the news room television monitors at 11:35 central
time, there will be a replay of the television transmission
that occurred at 11 hours, 6 minutes <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a>. This transmission
ran 1 hour, 5 minutes. We repeat in the, over the news center
television monitors, there will be a reshowing of the television
transmission that occurred at 11:06 <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> and ran for 1 hour and
a half minute - 1 hour and 5 minutes. This will be at 11:35
central time. We're at 19 hours, 33 minutes into the flight
and this is Apollo Control Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control Houston, at
20 hours, 32 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 14.
Our displays now show Apollo 14 at a distance of 89,728
nautical miles [166,176 km] away from Earth, and travelling at a speed
of 5,603.7 feet per second [1,708.0 m/s]. The surgeon reports the
three crew members, Shephard, Roosa, Mitchell are sleeping
quite soundly. We shall remain in sleep time of five hours
27 minutes and at this time we'll take down the release
line to replay the television transmission of early this
morning - of early this morning, and this will be available
on the monitors in the news center. We're at 20 hours,
33 minutes and this is Apollo Control Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, Houston at
21 hours, 41 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 14. We
presently show the 14 spacecraft at a distance of 93,355
nautical miles [172,893 km] and traveling at a speed of 5,435 feet per
second [1,657 m/s]. As the rest period for the crew continues the Flight
Control team here at Mission Control will be considering
possible flight plan changes or updating the flight
plan both for the balance of our shift and the next shift
to come on. The crew wakeup time now shows that it's 4 hours,
18 minutes away. We're 21 hours, 42 minutes into the flight.
This is Apollo Control, Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, Houston, at
22 hours and 12 minutes now into the flight. We now show
Apollo 14 at a distance of 94,979 nautical miles [175,901 km] away from
Earth and that it is traveling at a speed of 5,362 feet per
second [1,634 m/s]. During this quiet period while the crew is resting,
a replay of last night's docking is being rerun on one of the -
on the screen here in Mission Control. A space shuttle news
conference featuring Mr. Charles Mathews is scheduled to be
held in the News Center briefing room at 1:30 pm - about
15 minutes from this time. We' re at 22 hours, 13 minutes
into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control Houston at
23 hours, presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 98,566
nautical miles [182,544 km] out from Earth, and traveling at a velocity
of 5,205 feet per second [1,586 m/s]. The crew of Apollo 14 is continuing
with their rest period, however, our Flight Surgeon
advises that the Lunar Module Pilot, Ed Mitchell plugged in
his biomed at 22 hours, 50 minutes. This would assume about
7 hours of sleep time. Meanwhile, we have preliminary times,
distances and velocities of certain milestone events en route
to the Moon. These are preliminary times, distances and
velocities. The halfway in distance in terms of time, that
would be at a ground elapsed time of 27 hours, 4 minutes
42 seconds. The altitude would be 109,172 nautical miles [202,187 km].
The velocity, relative to Earth is 4,779 feet per second [1,457 m/s].
Velocity relative to the Moon 3,694 feet per second [1,126 m/s]. Halfway
in terms of time - this from liftoff to lunar orbit
insertion. The time would be 40 hours, 56 minutes. The
altitude, relative to the Earth, 142,119 nautical miles [263,204 km].
The altitude relative to Moon 81,723 nautical miles [151,351 km]. A
velocity relative to the Earth, 3,601 feet per second [1,098 m/s]. The
velocity relative to the Moon, 3,261.7 feet per second [994.2 m/s].
Sphere crossing time, when we cross from the Earth to the
lunar sphere of influence 66 hours, 3 minutes 7 seconds.
The velocity match - when the velocity of the Moon equals
the velocity of the Earth at the ground elapsed time of
47 hours, 43 minutes. The velocity reading at that time,
3,214 feet per second [980 m/s]. With regard to the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a>, the present
forecast time of impact, 82 hours, 37 minutes, 10 seconds. The
velocity at impact 8,347 feet per second [2,544 m/s]. Present predicted
coordinates 9 degrees 2409 minutes south 25 degrees 600 west
We also would like to advise all news men that there will be
a briefing, a News Conference on Apollo 14 mission status
in the big auditorium at 3 o'clock. Participants include Rocco
Petrone, Apollo Program Director, Chet Lee, Apollo 14 Mission
Director, Jim McDivitt, Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager in
Houston and Sig Sjoberg, Director of Flight Operations at
the Manned Spacecraft Center. We repeat that the Apollo 14
Mission Status News Conference at 3 o'clock in the big auditorium
of Building 1. We're at 23 hours, 28 minutes into the
flight and this is Apollo Control Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, Houston at
23 hours, 42 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 14. Apollo 14
presently 99 thousand 5 hundred and 21 nautical miles [184,313 km] away
from Earth, and traveling at a speed of 51 hundred 65 feet
per second [1,574 m/s]. We would like to repeat our earlier announcement
that Apollo 14 mission status news conference will be held
at the big auditorium of Building 1 starting at 3 pm.
Participants will include, Mr. Rocco Patrone, Apollo Program
Director, Colonel James McDivitt, Apollo Spacecraft Program
manager at the manned spacecraft center, Mr. Chet Lee,
mission director for Apollo 14, and Mr. Sig Sjoberg, the
manned spacecraft centers director of flight operations.
We're up to 23 hours, 43 minutes, and this is Apollo Control,
Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control Houston at
24 hours, 58 minutes into the flight of Apollo 14. At present
we show Apollo 14 at 103,220 nautical miles [191,163 km] from Earth.
Present velocity now reads 5,012 feet per second [1,528 m/s]. While our
clocks are continuing to countdown, it shows the rest period
ending at 1 hour, 1 minute from this time. This is Apollo
Control, Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, Houston
at 25 hours, 41 minutes now into the flight. Apollo 14
now 105,282 nautical miles [194,982 km] away from Earth and traveling
at a speed of 4,929 feet per second [1,502 m/s]. The present plan in
Mission Control is to not contact the crew of Apollo 14
until 27 hours ground elapsed time. One hour later than
the flight plan calls for. Even if the crew should awaken
and be about and in contact with Mission Control via voice
communication the flight plan will effectively in certain
areas move back by one hour. All of the activities presently
listed in the <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> is between 26 and 27 hours would move
back one hour. The launch vehicle systems debriefing
would move back to start at 28 hours ground elapsed time.
The P23 cislunar navigation star sightings scheduled in the
flight plan to start at 28 hours, 30 minutes have been
deleted. The purpose of this to conserve on the reaction
control system propellants. The <a href="acron.html#deltav"><font color=#206020>Delta-V</font></a> test and no Bias
check and the <a href="acron.html#p52"><font color=#206020>P52</font></a> platform alinements have been delayed
until 29 hours, 10 minutes ground elapsed time. The passive
thermal control exit has been delayed until 29 hours, 45 minutes
ground elapsed time. So the crew will in effect have an
extra hour of rest. We're now at 25 hours, 43 minutes into
the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, Houston.
We're picking up conversation with the crew at this point
and we'll switch to that conversation."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "Apollo Control at 26 hours, 3 minutes.
You heard that conversation with - those conversations with
the crew. The crew sounding alert and wide awake. The launch
vehicle debriefing time will not be changed, however, it
it appears likely that other events in the flight plan preceding
that may very well take place at the leisure of the
crew. We're at 26 hours, 4 minutes into the flight. We show
Apollo 14 at a ..."<p>

</font>
<b>026:03:50 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 14, Houston.<p>

<b>026:03:53 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Houston. I read you now.<p>

<b>026:03:55 Fullerton:</b> Roger. I think we rotated between a couple
antennas there. Got you loud and clear now.<p>

<b>026:04:01 Mitchell:</b> For my sleep, I slept for about 4 hours straight and then another 2 or
3 intermittently, and I feel very good.<p>

<b>026:04:10 Fullerton:</b> Roger.<p>

<b>026:04:16 Shepard:</b> Now, about the same for me and feel like [Garbled.]<p>

<b>026:04:22 Fullerton:</b> Al, this is Houston. You're very very weak. Would you repeat?<p>

<b>026:04:28 Shepard:</b> Okay. I had a sleep cycle about the same for me. I slept soundly for 4
or 5 hours, and then intermittently for another 2 - and we feel excellent up here.<p>

<b>026:04:43 Fullerton:</b> Roger, Al. For some reason, you're not nearly as readable as Ed is,
and it sounds like - well, I guess I can't really say what the problem is there on - on your mike.
You're getting a lot of - interference when you start and stop a transmission - I got no
suggestion on what to do to improve it. [Long pause]<p>

<b>026:05:11 Shepard:</b> Okay. How do you read this?<p>

<b>026:05:13 Fullerton:</b> That's a lot better, Al.<p>

<b>026:05:17 Shepard:</b> Okay. The mike was a long way away from my mouth.
[Garbled] Did you get the sleep report?<p>

<b>026:05:26 Fullerton:</b> I think we got it. Four to 5 hours good sleep and a little bit
intermittent after that. Is that about it?<p>

<b>026:05:34 Shepard:</b> That's correct. The general condition is excellent.<p>

<b>026:05:40 Fullerton:</b> Al, you're still - breaking up. I really can't give you a good
description of what - is wrong, but - you're just not very readable.<p>

<b>026:05:56 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Stand by on that one, Houston. We'll work on it.<p>

<b>026:05:59 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Ed.<p>

<b>026:06:01 Mitchell:</b> And, Houston. I'll go ahead and - start charging Bat A with your
concurrence, and we have changed the LiOH canister.<p>

<b>026:06:09 Fullerton:</b> Roger. That's - affirmative. You can go ahead with that, and - also
give us the - <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>/<a href="acron.html#cm">CM</a> <a href="acron.html#deltap">Delta-P</a> as shown at the 27 hours there, when it's convenient.<p>

<b>026:06:26 Mitchell:</b> [Garbled.]<p>

<b>026:06:36 Roosa:</b> And, Gordon, this is Stu. How do you read?<p>

<b>026:06:39 Fullerton:</b> You're loud and clear, Stu.<p>

<b>026:06:42 Roosa:</b> Okay. I guess on my sleep I'll split it with you about
half. I'll say I got 5 hours.<p>

<b>026:06:49 Fullerton:</b> Roger.<p>

<b>026:06:55 Roosa:</b> My mattress was hard.<p>

<b>026:06:57 Fullerton:</b> Roger. When you're ready to copy, I have some words on - some changes
we've figured out for the flight plan. [Long pause]<p>

<b>026:07:14 Mitchell:</b> Stand by a minute. [Long pause]<p>

<b>026:07:36 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Houston. Go ahead with your changes in the flight plan.<p>

<b>026:07:40 Fullerton:</b> Okay. Before we start, one reminder is that - when you went to sleep,
we didn't get any presleep checklist. If there was anything - out of the ordinary there, we'll -
presleep report that was - and - we'll take any - Stand by, I'm getting some words from the
surgeon here. Okay. Just disregard it. It's sort of - We'll need the - both the pre- and postsleep
reports from here on out. Okay, on the flight plan, if you're ready. [Long pause]<p>

<b>026:08:25 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Go ahead.<p>

<b>026:08:28 Fullerton:</b> Roger. We're going to delay the launch vehicle systems debriefing
until 28 hours. And - the P23, which is scheduled at 28:30, we're going to cancel, which will save
us some <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a>. On - along that line, the results of the last P23 that Stu did, the horizon that he
shot at was 28 plus or minus 5 kilometers, and - that's right on the preflight values so an update
will not be required. And your average error for pointing error was 3 arc minutes, which rank is
right in there with the best ever recorded, and - the expert gives you a pat on the back, Stu, and
said it was an outstanding Job. [Long pause]<p>

<b>026:09:33 Roosa:</b> Ah, Jove! Thank you, Gordon.<p>

<b>026:09:37 Fullerton:</b> Okay. On with the flight plan. The <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> test and null bias check
and the <a href="acron.html#p52">P52</a>, we're going to delay that until 29:10 <a href="acron.html#get">GET</a>. [Long pause]<p>

<b>026:10:01 Shepard:</b> Okay. So far, I have that we do the launch vehicle debrief at 28 hours
to [sic] 27 hours. We're delaying the null bias and the <a href="acron.html#p52">P52</a> at 28:10 until
29:10; We're canceling the P23 at 28:30.<p>

<b>026:10:20 Fullerton:</b> That's affirmative, Al. And - and then further after that, we're going
to delay the exit of <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> until 29 and 55. And when we do exit <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a>, go right
into the midcourse 2 pad attitude. [Long pause]<p>

<b>026:10:45 Shepard:</b> Okay. <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> to 29:55 and then set up for midcourse 2.<p>

<b>026:10:51 Fullerton:</b> Roger. And on all other activities will be nominal, except - on waste
water dump - you want - We want you to dump to zero percent quantity.<p>

<b>026:11:05 Shepard:</b> Okay. Dump the waste water to zero.<p>

<b>026:11:08 Fullerton:</b> Okay. We have one additional question for the launch vehicle systems
performance debriefing. We can either give it to you now so you can think about it, or wait until
you get around to it to give it to you. Your choice.<p>

<b>026:11:27 Shepard:</b> We will take it now.<p>

<b>026:11:30 Fullerton:</b> Okay. The question is, you announced during the docking attempts that
you thought the booster was maneuvering a little bit. We'd like you to expand on the direction of
the maneuver: the type of maneuver, lateral or oscillating, or any other words to that effect; the
approximate time the maneuver was first observed, whether it was before the first docking attempt,
between the first or second, or if you can relate it to any other activity; any observed vents
from the launch vehicle during the maneuver; and anything else unusual or
unexpected that you noticed. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>026:12:18 Shepard:</b> Okay, question number 10. Describe the type, direction, and the time
relation of the booster maneuvers during docking, and any events that we noticed during maneuvers.<p>

<b>026:12:28 Fullerton:</b> Roger; and I was just thinking as I read it that, on that time, we can
probably go back on the tape and find out when you mentioned it as far as tying down the time
accurately, and that might be easier for us to get than you.<p>

<b>026:12:42 Shepard:</b> Okay, that would probably help us; thank you.<p>

<b>026:12:44 Roosa:</b> Hey, that - that's no sweat, Gordon. I - I remember the - the comment when
I made it, and what the circumstances were.<p>

<b>026:12:51 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Stu. I think that takes care of all the
words they got for you right at the moment. [Long pause]<p>

when Mission Control, in fact, received a call from the crew,
Mitchell, Roosa and Commander Al Shepard had spent almost
this entire time in a rest period. In the Mission Control
Center our flight plan update was in progress for a better
period of the time. The plan as it evolved, did not plan to
awaken the crew until 27 hours <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a>, but the crew woke up
almost per flight plan schedule. Commander Al Shepard reported
7 hours deep and intermittent sleep as did Lunar

sleep time. As we look ahead to the next shift, we also
look ahead to the midcourse two - maneuver and as we had

<b>027:50:34 McCandless:</b> 14, this is Houston; go ahead.<p>

<b>027:50:38 Roosa:</b> Roger. I think we're all hooked up and ready to go.<p>

<b>027:50:43 McCandless:</b> Roger. I guess number 1 question would be, is - was there ever more
than one bottle selected on the docking probe, and if so, which ones.<p>

<b>027:50:57 Shepard:</b> That's negative. [Garbled] primary one, and that's the one we used.<p>

<b>027:51:03 McCandless:</b> Roger; very good. How many times was the Extend/ Release position of
the docking probe extension retraction switch operated, and for when and about how long was it
held in these positions? Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>027:51:23 Shepard:</b> Well, it was operated per flight plan for the initial extension, and the
dock latch worked normally. We felt a jar, a good solid thump, but it went on out and then it was
not operated again until after the problem started. At the ground suggestion, we went to
Extend/Release and then back to Retract - I think twice - no more than twice. [Long pause]<p>

<b>027:51:57 McCandless:</b> Okay, so - grand total, I guess we could say that you've had three
cycles to the Extend/Release position; the one nominal one, and the two after the problem started
developing? Is that correct?<p>

<b>027:52:12 Shepard:</b> Let's call it no more than four, Bruce. We did one of them on our own,
so one normal and no more than three additional.<p>

<b>027:52:21 McCandless:</b> Roger. We copy.<p>

<b>027:52:24 Roosa:</b> And, Bruce, no response at all except for the first
one, which went normally.<p>

<b>027:52:31 McCandless:</b> Okay, on the first one there, you were actually
causing the probe to extend, were you not?<p>

<b>027:52:38 Roosa:</b> That's affirmative. We extended it, and, as Al said, we heard her clunk in
and the talkbacks did their thing, flashed barber pole and then went to gray, as advertised.<p>

<b>027:52:50 McCandless:</b> Okay, then on the subsequent ones about all we'd be operating is the
capture latch cocking motor.<p>

<b>027:53:00 Roosa:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>027:53:01 McCandless:</b> They probably wouldn't feel that in the form of a mechanical shock or
anything like that. And ...<p>

<b>027:53:06 Roosa:</b> Roger.<p>

<b>027:53:08 McCandless:</b> You may want to kick this next one around before you answer us on it
and make sure you got all the details lined up. We'd like you to go through the procedure in as
much detail as you can on the final docking, including the switch position, talkback indications,
the dynamics, the order of your contact with the - with the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> drogue, the plus-X thrusting, the
barber poles, the bottle selection, and the actual probe retraction. I think you mentioned
yesterday that you had a 3-second delay in probe retraction, and we'd like to know when that
3-second delay was measured, starting, that is, from throwing the switch or
from some other event. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>027:53:57 Shepard:</b> Okay. I'll start off by saying that all the switches were per checklist.
And, of course, those were one of the first things that we verified at - when the problem
occurred, at your suggestion as well as our own. And - everything was normal up to the point where
Stu made his first contact. I'll let him take it on in from there.<p>

<b>027:54:23 Roosa:</b> Okay, Bruce, why don't we just back up a little bit, and you - you asked
for the specific one where we got the - the docking, but let's go back to the first one, and
everything looked just real fine coming in on it. I'd say the - the whole docking operation was
just so much like the <a href="acron.html#cms">CMS</a> that it was hard to believe. I mean the - the procedures, and the view,
and the response of the vehicle, and I'd say I had 2/10ths of a foot per second closing speed. And
then, the reaction when I hit the drogue was just exactly like the - you know, the docking trainer
that we had where you didn't hit the capture latches, but you just went in and
banged into the drogue? [Long pause]<p>

<b>027:55:11 McCandless:</b> Roger. The one over there in building 5?<p>

<b>027:55:15 Roosa:</b> Yes. That's the exact response I got. On the first one, I - I klonked into
it and - you know - and then I could tell that I was slipping out, and, of course, Al didn't call
the barber pole. So, at that time, I did the natural thing and jabbed it with a little plus-X, and
drove it into the drogue, and we were lined up good. I was holding plus-X and the - the alinement
- you know - still good on the - on the target just like - you know - you can do in the docking
trainer. Okay, and then I realized that it hadn't made contact, so I let her back off. At that
time we called you, and I said, "Well, I'll try it again," and increase the velocity. And, on this
one, I'm estimating that my contact velocity was about a foot per second. Now, it might have been
a little less than that. As you know, a foot-per-second closing looks like you're going to run
right through the thing, so - but I would - I've looked at a lot of these on the simulator and I'd
say that probably the second one was right at a foot per second. And got the - got the same
response - and I really can't remember whether that's the one where you told me to try plus-X
after I hit or not. You know, I had already done that on the first one, but anyway, if this was
the one, then I hit - you said, oh 3 seconds; I held 4, and no - no luck at all. We came back out.
At that time, I suggested we fall back, regroup, and talk about it. And then, y'all pretty much
know the story then. You suggested that we try it again with everything normal, and I guess the
second time there was - I contacted and I - that was not the time I held the plus-X. It was the
next one on your suggestion. Yes, the second one I - I did it on my own and then you - on the
third one you said, let's try a normal docking and hold 3 seconds, and I did that and held 4. And,
also, it was after the second docking that I noticed the radial scratches and - and at that time,
that's when I became convinced that from the action and then seeing the scratches, that the
docking latches were not giving and were indeed locked, instead of the cocked position. Okay, so
we went through that one as you suggested, and I held plus-X 4 seconds and - we're right in -
right in the drogue - you know - holding steady. And then we came out and then
down to - to the last time ...

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>027:58:16 McCandless:</b> Stu?<p>

<b>027:58:17 Roosa:</b> I came in, I'd say probably about a tenth, maybe 0.15, in that area,
two-tenths, maybe a little less, contacted it and, at contact, the - the attitude stayed fairly
good. There was maybe a degree and a half, 2-degree pitchup movement on the <a href="acron.html#coas">COAS</a>. I then applied
the plus-X and held it. At that time, I put it in the center of the drogue, and the <a href="acron.html#coas">COAS</a> and the
reticle and the translation were all just looking real good, and so I gave the cue to Al to
retract, and he hit the Retract switch at that point. And then I let him take it from there. [Long pause]<p>

<b>027:59:06 McCandless:</b> Stu, before you press on, where in this sequence of dockings did you
actuate the Extend/Release switch position again? Over.<p>

<b>027:59:20 Roosa:</b> Okay. It would be after the second attempt. We - It was per your
suggestion - the ground suggestion, and we went through the extend/release - in through there -
No, wait a minute, we tried it ourselves after the second one, didn't we? Okay, consensus here is,
after the first one, we went back to Off and then back to Retract. And then after the second one,
we went to Extend and then back to Retract. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:00:05 McCandless:</b> Okay, and did you do anything with the Extend/ Retract switch after
the last unsuccessful docking but prior to the final successful one? [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:00:48 Shepard:</b> I don't think we did, Bruce. We did - We told you everything we did with
that switch. [Garbled] from Retract to Off and then back to Retract again.<p>

<b>028:01:04 McCandless:</b> Okay, now, in going through this sequence, did you ever move the
docking probe retract, that is, the Bottle Select switch off of Primary 1; that is, did you
recycle that switch or do anything in this sequence? Or did you just leave it in that position
once you'd initially selected it?<p>

<b>028:01:25 Shepard:</b> Well, we don't touch that switch until we get the capture latches. We
stay to the Off position until ...<p>

<b>028:01:32 McCandless:</b> Okay. Roger. Copy. Okay. So we're coming up on the final successful
docking here, and you told us that you got this 1-1/2, 2 degrees pitchup on the <a href="acron.html#coas">COAS</a> that looked
pretty good. You applied plus-X and held, and I think that's where I broke in. Go ahead. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:01:56 Roosa:</b> Okay, and then on the plus-X then that - that brought the - you know - the
<a href="acron.html#coas">COAS</a> right down and the alinement - then everything was fine and translation was - was real good
all the way except - except like I say, for that - you know - small pitchup - a degree and half or
whatever it was, right at contact as the - as the probe sliding into the drogue. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:02:27 McCandless:</b> Okay, and did you ...<p>

<b>028:02:28 Shepard:</b> And when - when Stu called out Retract, I went to Retract position on
Primary 1. And it looked pretty normal from there. Just long enough - to - for you - to say to
yourself, "Well, it hasn't worked." And then it went barber pole and gray and simultaneously there
we got the feeling that we'd hard docked. So it's probably about a 3-second time period from the
time I went to Primary 1 until I had barber pole, and approximately a second
later after that, to gray and the hard dock. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:03:09 McCandless:</b> Okay. Stand by.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>028:05:25 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston.<p>

<b>028:05:29 Mitchell:</b> Go ahead.<p>

<b>028:05:31 McCandless:</b> Roger. Were you thrusting plus-X all the time from initial contact
until the time that you got the hard docking? Over.<p>

<b>028:05:40 Roosa:</b> That's affirmative, Bruce. Once I got her in the drogue - you know, we'd
talked among ourselves, and we told Al to hold off until I'm thrusting and I'm satisfied with the
alinement. So when we made contact and I thrusted and it looked like we were - Everything was
good, and I - I held a positive plus-X all the way until we got the - the latches. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:06:08 McCandless:</b> Okay, now. From contact, when you started thrusting plus-X, did you
feel anything after the initial contact that would indicate that you'd moved on in and seated the
probe in the center of the drogue? Specifically, do you feel that at the time that you selected
Retract, the probe head was in such a position in the drogue that you should have already been in
a barber pole position on the talkbacks ? Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:06:40 Roosa:</b> Well, Bruce, the - the probe was obviously in the drogue, but - you know -
there's no way of knowing. But the feeling among us here and - my feeling is that, no, I don't
think we had capture latch lock until after we went to Primary. Now, I - You know; I'm sure y'all
have looked at it and you've got people down there tearing the probe apart, but I don't even know
if it's physically possible. But I don't feel that we had any capture latches in that hole until
that last operation when we went to Primary and drove the beauty in there. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:07:25 McCandless:</b> Okay. Do you feel like the - the probe head was in such a position -
do you feel like the position of the probe head changed on you any after you went to Primary?<p>

<b>028:07:38 Roosa:</b> No. No. I was watching the - the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> - I was plus-X-ing and Al called
"Primary," and we started closing on it and there was no movement; no. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:08:17 McCandless:</b> Okay. We copy. No movement after - after you started the plus-X and
got yourself seated in there until such time as the bottle fired; that is, no
- no more closing movement. Is that correct?<p>

<b>028:08:34 Roosa:</b> That's affirmative. As far as I can - you know - tell, we were there,
thrusting, holding steady - Okay, do you read me, Bruce?<p>

<b>028:08:47 McCandless:</b> Roger. Reading you loud and clear, Stu.<p>

<b>028:08:51 Roosa:</b> Okay. And - you know, we got - We're sitting steady in the drogue, plus-X,
everything looking fine. We hit the Retract switch and we start moving together. I didn't hear
anything nor see any action until we heard the latches close.<p>

<b>028:09:11 McCandless:</b> Roger. But while you were sitting there then - the talkback was gray
and then 3 seconds after you went to Primary, approximately, it went
barberpole and the nominal sequence started.<p>

<b>028:09:22 Shepard:</b> Well, I was looking at the talkbacks, and that's about the only thing we
saw as we pointed out before. About 3 seconds after the initiation of the primary contact - of the
Primary Retract switch to the 1 - number 1 position, they went barber pole for perhaps a quarter
or a half a second and then went gray simultaneously with the hard dock.<p>

<b>028:09:46 McCandless:</b> Roger.<p>

<b>028:09:56 Roosa:</b> Hey, Bruce?<p>

<b>028:09:57 McCandless:</b> Go ahead, Stu.<p>

<b>028:10:00 Roosa:</b> Okay. And on that one, we've sort of hassled this out. I guess it's
something we need- We're probably going to get to, but we - Yesterday, you know, we called it a
ripple fire and we felt like we had them all, which we did; but it really felt like the - the
latches - we got a couple or, you know, it's hard to say how many; but we got some latches and
then at some discrete time, maybe a quarter of a second or something like that; then we got the
rest of them in a ripple. So, I think we got the docking latches in two distinct times, separated
by, you know, a very small amount. But at least it was enough to say it was
not one continuous ripple fire. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:10:48 McCandless:</b> Okay, Stu. We copy that and I guess one last point on this - this
final docking sequence. Did the closure of the two vehicles start when you selected Primary and
continue for some period of time with the barber pole indication appearing during this period of
closure, or did the flash to barber pole and then back coincide with the
beginning of the closure for hard docking? [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:11:19 Roosa:</b> Hey, let us talk about that one for a second, Bruce.<p>

<b>028:11:21 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:11:44 Mitchell:</b> Bruce, let me give you my opinion from the right seat. We're
coordinated, I think, on the way this happened. I saw us move in as in previous attempts. We hit,
moved just a little bit to improve alinement as the drogue forced the probe toward the center, and
we started to bounce - it looked like we bounced - started to bounce back out. Stu hit the plus-X
thrust and held it for what appeared to be right in the middle of the drogue with thrust. He
called the Retract. Al hit the Retract, and a moment after that, it seemed like we started to move
together. Al then called barber pole, called gray, and we were moving together continuously during
this time; and then I heard the - the fire go off on the - the latches making. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:12:42 McCandless:</b> Okay. We copy that, Ed. Thank you.<p>

<b>028:12:46 Mitchell:</b> No. We did not [Answering <a href="acron.html#cdr">CDR</a> or <a href="acron.html#cmp">CMP</a>].<p>

<b>028:12:54 McCandless:</b> And I wonder if you could comment on the thrusting activity
immediately after contact for each docking.<p>

<b>028:13:06 Roosa:</b> Okay. As I said on the first one, I - was going along ...<p>

<b>028:13:12 McCandless:</b> I think we're referring - We're referring more to the nature of
stable - attitude control or stabilization thrusting other than the plus-X. I think you've pretty
well covered the plus-X for us.<p>

<b>028:13:24 Roosa:</b> Oh, that's the only thrusting I did. That's all it took to - to aline it.
I did no other movements either with the <a href="acron.html#rhc">RHC</a> or the <a href="acron.html#thc">THC</a> after contact except plus-X.<p>

<b>028:13:36 McCandless:</b> Okay. We copy that.<p>

<b>028:13:39 Mitchell:</b> Bruce, the probe was sufficiently close to the center of the drogue on
each of those contacts. I believe that the marks that we pointed out to you on television
yesterday represent the initial contact of the probe. It could not have been more than an inch and
a half or 2 inches from the center of the drogue at that time on any of the contacts.<p>

<b>028:13:57 McCandless:</b> All right. It looks like Stu was right in there in the center from
what we could see on the - the TV last night on those contacts.<p>

<b>028:14:06 Mitchell:</b> That's affirmative. It looked the same way out the right window.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>028:15:50 McCandless:</b> 14, this is Houston. In the process of making the docking yesterday,
we advised you to check some circuit breakers, which you did. Did you at any time cycle any of
these circuit breakers, that is, open and then reclose them? Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:16:14 Roosa:</b> Okay. All we did was check them. That's the group 4 and the docking probe
circuit breakers. I Just checked them, you know, by pushing on them; but, no, we did not pull any
and then push them back in.<p>

<b>028:16:28 McCandless:</b> Okay. We copy. And that about winds up our queries on the
docking-probe situation. We'll be ready to go on the - the launch-vehicle
debrief here in a minute or so.<p>

<b>028:16:40 Shepard:</b> Okay, Bruce.<p>

<b>028:16:43 Roosa:</b> Okay.

<b>028:18:37 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston.<p>

<b>028:18:41 Mitchell:</b> Go ahead, Houston.<p>

<b>028:18:43 McCandless:</b> Roger. Last night on the docking probe removal, after you took the
preload off the probe, could you tell whether the probe head was, in fact,
locked into the drogue at that time or not? [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:19:06 Roosa:</b> No - I - It - it appeared to be, Bruce. I took the preload off. In fact, I
think Al made that question and we both looked up around at the probe head to see if we could see
anything that looked unusual about it or whether it looked like it was out or anything, and - and
it did not. Everything looked - looked normal. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:19:36 McCandless:</b> Could you - could you feel and tell whether the head of the probe was
locked into the drogue or not?<p>

<b>028:19:49 Roosa:</b> No. I guess the answer to that would be we don't know. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:20:11 Roosa:</b> But now, I guess as you've realized, after I collapsed
the - the probe, it definitely was.<p>

<b>028:20:20 McCandless:</b> Okay. You say after you collapsed the probe, the head of the thing
was definitely locked in there?<p>

<b>028:20:28 Roosa:</b> Yes. It was hanging in there and I had to apply a little tug to - to get
it out. I went right by the decal on the checklist, and I think you asked at that time about the
force that it took to bring it out; and it appeared, you know, reasonably normal for the first
time that I had done it in - in zero g. It didn't appear to be anything funny about it. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:21:04 Mitchell:</b> Bruce, let's make it clear. There's no question about the capture
latches being through the drogue. But the question of whether they were locked or not is the one
we don't know the answer to.<p>

<b>028:21:16 McCandless:</b> Right. That, of course, is the question that we
were trying to get out here just now.

<b>028:27:40 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:28:17 Shepard:</b> Okay, Houston. On question number 1, regarding the changes in noise
level, the only change in noise level that we noticed was during the first part of the launch on
the <a href="acron.html#sic">S-IC</a>, when we had the initial noise of ignition and the buildup in noise
during <a href="acron.html#maxq">Max q</a>. And, of course, the associated - [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:28:52 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston. I think we're coming up on an antenna switchover for
you. You seem to be fading down into the mud.<p>

<b>028:29:01 Shepard:</b> Okay. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:29:18 Shepard:</b> Are you reading, now, Houston?<p>

<b>028:29:21 McCandless:</b> Okay. We're reading you better signal strengthwise, Al. We still seem
to be getting a little bit of breakup from your comm carrier. Can you
reposition the mike? See if that helps any.<p>

<b>028:29:33 Shepard:</b> Okay. I have the mike right in front of my mouth
right now. Is that better?<p>

<b>028:29:37 McCandless:</b> Roger. I think we better take it from the top again.<p>

<b>028:29:46 Shepard:</b> Okay, from the top. The only significant change in noise level we
noticed was, as mentioned, due to the burning of the engine in the atmosphere, that is, the
ignition, of course, a buildup of noise there. And the noise level increased through <a href="acron.html#maxq">Max q</a>, and
then a dropoff. Other than that, with respect to the noise itself, we had no problems at all in
our communications at any time during the stages of the flight. Does that satisfy everybody on 1? [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:30:26 McCandless:</b> That's affirmative. Press on.<p>

<b>028:30:33 Shepard:</b> Okay. Number 2. On the <a href="acron.html#sic">S-IC</a>, we noticed no significant changes in noise
level and vibration, other than what we just discussed. <a href="acron.html#sic">S-IC</a> we felt was a real fine ride, nothing
unexpected. The <a href="acron.html#sii">S-II</a>, we noticed a change in vibration, a sort of a slight pogo, which started at
8 plus 40. Nothing of very - of any great magnitude. And on the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> to orbit burn, we noticed no
significant changes in the noise and vibration level. We noticed nothing unusual on <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> during
<a href="acron.html#tli">TLI</a> ignition. However, we did notice the beginning of a slight hum, low hum, or buzz toward the
end of the <a href="acron.html#tli">TLI</a> burn. That's it for number 2. Do you have any questions there? [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:31:50 McCandless:</b> We have no questions right now on that, Al. We're closing our loop
down here with the Huntsville Operations Support Center, so it takes us a - a few seconds to a
minute or so to get a response back. Why don't you press on with the question number 3? If we get
any queries, why, we'll reopen the previous ones.<p>

<b>028:32:11 Shepard:</b> Okay. On number 3, nothing unexpected in the way of transients on which
we had not been briefed. As a matter of fact, it went pretty much according to the way we had
expected it through all the events mentioned in question 3, that is, ignition and staging, engine
shutdown, mixture ratios, and so on. We did experience a little more abruptness with the cut-off
of <a href="acron.html#sii">S-II</a>. The <a href="acron.html#sii">S-II</a> SECO, I think, we [Garbled] a little more than we expected. Otherwise,
everything was pretty much the way we'd kind of planned them. Question 3. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:32:59 McCandless:</b> Roger. Question 4.<p>

<b>028:33:02 Shepard:</b> Okay. Stu is ready for you on question 4.<p>

<b>028:33:05 Roosa:</b> Okay, Bruce. I got a good look at that shroud, of course, station keeping
with the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a>, and you couldn't see all of it; but, as we moved around, you could see a good

portion of it back around behind the - the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> and every place that I could see and Ed also and Al
- Al was looking through the hatch window part of the time, and everything looked just tight as a
drum. We saw no loose pieces of the shroud anywhere. Nothing out of the ordinary, and after Sep -
as the - I mean after ejection and the booster came into view - came into my window pretty much of
a head-on view, and we were out a little ways, but there was no - no visible damage at all to the
shroud at any time. And, like I say, I think we got a real good look at it the
time we spent around it. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:34:07 McCandless:</b> Roger. We copy.<p>

<b>028:34:12 Shepard:</b> Okay. Going on to - going on to number 5. We experienced good
communications throughout the entire powered flight and launch. We've been able to hear the ground
on all the calls, and we had no comm problems at all. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:34:36 McCandless:</b> Roger.<p>

<b>028:34:37 Shepard:</b> How about you, Jim? Any comm problems from us?<p>

<b>028:34:44 McCandless:</b> Negative. We experienced no comm problems.<p>

<b>028:34:51 Shepard:</b> Okay, question number 6. Was there visible venting?
Stu, do you want to take over, now?<p>

<b>028:34:57 Roosa:</b> Okay. We didn't see any - anything unusual other than those that you
called; and when you called the venting while we were station keeping, well, of course, it came
on, rather beautiful sight. And the only other thing was when you gave a mark for the <a href="acron.html#aps">APS</a> evasive
burn, why, I noticed the booster venting and it appeared to be the same area as it had been
venting during the station keeping phase; and the answer came back that that was expected, and so
forth; and that was the only thing out of the ordinary. Other than that, everything was fine and
all the other vents you called. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:35:46 McCandless:</b> Okay, on to number 7. I guess that one may still be open.<p>

<b>028:35:52 Roosa:</b> Yes, I was just trying to whip off a fast answer for you on that one, but
we don't have any. So I guess that Al will tell you the last time that we - we saw it.<p>

<b>028:36:04 Shepard:</b> Well, I guess the last time we saw the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> was with the eyeball
[Garbled] that is, and it was during the propulsion venting. It was kind of a tough angle for us
to see because of - it was just very low on the edge of window number 1. However, the sun angle on
it was good; it was stable when it was venting, as near as I could tell, approximately, a couple
of miles away. We took a few pictures of it with the Hasselblad, so we may be able to see the
beautiful conical-shaped pattern coming from the venting; but as far as control was concerned, it
was going in the right direction and appeared to be stable. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:36:48 McCandless:</b> Roger. We copy. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:36:59 Shepard:</b> Okay, number 8. Stu, you want to take that one?<p>

<b>028:37:03 Roosa:</b> Okay, I guess the guidance obviously was good and the velocity was - was
real fine. It looked like, during the - during the boost phase, they were running a - maybe 2, 2
and a half miles, maybe 3 miles low along my profile, looked rather consistent; but we obviously
arrived at the right place, so the - and the velocity cut-offs were right on the money and the <a href="acron.html#tli">TLI</a>
guidance, I think, was within 10 feet, 17, or something like that. You've got the numbers, but it
looked real good, and the only thing I can comment there was it looked to me like we were going
into Earth orbit insertion maybe a couple or 3 low, pretty much on the profile. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:37:54 McCandless:</b> Roger.<p>

<b>028:37:55 Roosa:</b> All the way on the profile I should say.<p>

<b>028:38:05 Shepard:</b> Okay, are you ready for number 9?<p>

<b>028:38:08 McCandless:</b> Roger. Go ahead with number 9.<p>

<b>028:38:13 Shepard:</b> Okay. The <a href="acron.html#ordeal">ORDEAL</a> ball at ignition was as advertised at 8 and a half
degrees. After ignition, went to the normal pitchdown, the ball settled down very close to zero;
and, as the burn progressed, eased on up to about a plus-1 degree; then, slowly on back to zero;
then, close to the pitchdown, just prior to - to the cut-off. And I would say somewhere around 2
or 3 degrees negative, that is at 357 and 358 on the ball, prior to cut-off. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:38:58 McCandless:</b> Okay, and we've got one more write-in, Question
number 10; and it's based on -<p>

<b>028:39:07 Roosa:</b> Okay, I'll take that one, Bruce.<p>

<b>028:39:12 McCandless:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>028:39:13 Roosa:</b> Okay, Bruce. That - that came from my comment. And as we were station
keeping and watching the venting, it looked to me like the booster had picked up a little right
yaw as - as I looked at it. I meant - moving left on me, but then I just mentioned, it looked like
it was moving over a little; but then, later on, I decided that that was just the scatter of the
two vehicle's dead bands because the IU - the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> dead band all the time was solid as a rock,
even during the venting. And after all that venting, when I went back to - to try the other
dockings, I expected to have to change my attitude a little bit. And as it turned out, the
attitude was still - you know - right within a degree, so that was just a call that appeared to,
at that time. But the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> vented from both sides and it was steady. And I think I was just
picking up the movement of the dead bands of the two vehicles. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:40:20 McCandless:</b> Okay, Stu; thank you.<p>

<b>028:40:24 Roosa:</b> Roger. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:40:35 McCandless:</b> And while the Huntsville people are closing the loop here, we had
previously given you a flightplan update concerning your waste water dump at 30 hours plus 15
minutes, and our update was that you dump to zero percent. We'd like now to modify that to a
nominal dump to 25 percent on the waste water. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:41:01 Shepard:</b> Okay, we are now modified; 25 percent it shall be.<p>

<b>028:41:05 McCandless:</b> Roger; out.<p>

<b>028:41:09 Mitchell:</b> Could you tell me about Al's comm? You mentioned some dropouts in EKG
prior to launch. Apparently you're still not seeing those. Are they in any way associated with
these voice dropouts you talked about today? [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:41:30 McCandless:</b> Stand by, please.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>028:43:01 McCandless:</b> 14, this is Houston. Our belief is that there's no correlation at the
present time between your earlier EKG problems and the current degraded comm through Al's comm
carrier. We would like to suggest when you have the chance that Al try using the spare comm
carrier, and see if that improves communications.<p>

<b>028:43:26 Mitchell:</b> Okay, we'll shift over.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>028:44:53 McCandless:</b> 14, this is Houston. We've received some inquiries regarding your
answer to question number 2. The Huntsville Operations people would like to get a little more
detail on the slight hum or buzz. Was it actually an acoustic or audible noise, or was it felt
through the structure of the spacecraft, and can you give us approximately the time that it
commenced and duration, that is, did it proceed until <a href="acron.html#tli">TLI</a> cut-off? [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:45:36 Shepard:</b> Stand by 1, Houston.<p>

<b>028:45:37 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:46:14 Roosa:</b> Okay, Bruce. I think the noise is kind of hard to describe, I guess, and
maybe make ourselves clear, but it definitely was not an acoustic buzz. It was a high frequency
buzz that we felt through the structure; and, I'd say, it probably started - and this is an
approximation - say 2 minutes into the <a href="acron.html#tli">TLI</a> burn. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:46:43 McCandless:</b> Okay. And continued through the balance of the burn?<p>

<b>028:46:48 Roosa:</b> Pretty much so, yes. Just about the same level. I wouldn't say that it
increased any significant amount.<p>

<b>028:46:57 McCandless:</b> I realize this is sort of hard to put your finger on. Is there any
way you can quantify the level, or give us some feeling for how much of - how high the level was ? [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:47:18 Roosa:</b> No. No, I think that's pretty tough, Bruce. In fact, you know - the - the
burn was going so well and the ride was so smooth that - you know we - we had time to - to pick it
up. I suspect that, you know, it was low enough level that if you had something else on your mind,
you wouldn't even have noticed it. [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:47:45 McCandless:</b> Did this - did this just sort of start abruptly, or build up from the
background, do you think?<p>

<b>028:47:55 Roosa:</b> Well, Ed feels it was a buildup and I'm not sure. So let's vote that it

stayed at low level and - and was there.<p>

<b>028:48:13 McCandless:</b> Okay. And the only other question we got back in is at 8 Plus 40,
this pogo-type thing that you mentioned was - Could you give us a little more detail on direction

<b>028:48:33 Roosa:</b> Okay. I guess I called out the time on that one in the cockpit. I - It was
no doubt but what it was a slight pogo and I think it was longitudinal; and as far as amplitude,
I'm trying to think back to some of those pogo tests I road on the shake table, but they were of
such high level that I wouldn't - couldn't compare them to this. But, it was a pogo; it started to
slip out that time because when I - when I felt it, I looked at the clock and it was not ... [Long pause]<p>

<b>028:51:18 Roosa:</b> Oh, you're 5 square. The static's died down, and - As I was saying, there
was no question but what it was a low amplitude pogo starting right at 8 plus 40. However, the
magnitude was low enough that it was not affected - did not affect any of our voices; and, you
know, a fairly low level will - will do that, so I'd - I'd say, you know, it was pretty small. It
was not of any concern, but picked it up just because - you know - thinking about pogo, I guess. [Long pause]<p>

the crew periodically enters a velocity value of 100.0 and let the system run for 100 seconds.
An end value of say 98.4 means a change in velocity (delta V) of 1.6 feet per second in 100 seconds
which is 0.016 feet per second squared (0.5 centimeter per second squared).  Although this may not

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control, at 29 hours,
23 minutes. During the last 2 hours or so of this shift,
shortly after the maroon team of flight controllers came
on, we began preparing for the discussions on the probe
and also for the scheduled discussions on the booster performance
during the power ascent, during the launch phase.
During the discussions on the probe, among the comments
that were made by the crew, Roosa noted that there appeared
to be no capture latches activating until the probe was
retracted or as he put it, we got no capture latches until
we went to primary at which time the crew activated the
nitrogen pneumatic system which retracts the probe. Ed Mitchell
summed up the operation on the successful docking as Mitchell
described it, he said Stu Roosa, who was at the controls of
the spacecraft moved in on the drogue - he said we started
to bounce out and at that point Roosa held plus X on the
thrusters, moving the spacecraft into the center of the
drogue and said the vehicles began moving together as they
activated the primary switch which activates the pneumatic
system which retracts the drogue and at that point he said
Al called out barber pole and grey and then we got hard
docking. The talkback indicators that Mitchell was referring
to indicate initially that the probe is extended and the docking
latches - the capture latches are caught. The second indication
of barber pole indicates that the capture latches have
in fact captured and latched and finally the third indication
of grey shows that the main docking latches have engaged and
have closed - the hard docking latches.
<p>
Perhaps the most
significant comments during the discussion of the booster
were reports from the crew that they noticed a slight hum
or buzz as Roosa described it during a translunar injection
portion of the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> burn. Roosa noted that this very low
level hum or buzz, which he said could be felt through the
structure began about 2 minutes
into the <a href="acron.html#tli"><font color=#206020>TLI</font></a> burn. He also noted that it was slight enough
that had the crew had their minds on other things they
probably would not have noticed it. Flight Director
Milton Windler observed on the circuits here in the control
center that this is the sort of vibration or hum that has
been reported also by previous crews and there appear to
be no particular concern over this. Roosa also reported
a slight POGO in the second stage operation beginning at
8 minutes, 40 seconds ground elapsed time. He described
it as a longitudinal vibration, very light, very slight.
The one thing that he used to characterize this vibration
was to compare it with similar vibrations the crew members
have been subjected to on vibration tables. Roosa noted
that with even a relatively light POGO type vibration on a -
in a simulated situation, it's difficult to talk. He said
that this was light enough that it did not effect their
voices in the spacecraft.
<p>
The Capcom also advised the
crew that at about 54 hours that we will have the update
to the ground elapsed time clocks in mission control and
aboard the spacecraft. At this time the <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> clock, clock
that is currently reading <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> here in mission control will
be updated. It will be moved ahead so 40 minutes. The clock
that is currently designated TB5 will become the actual
ground elapsed time. In other words, that clock will display
the true ground elapsed time, the total amount of time that
has elapsed since lift-off. The clock which is designated
<a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> will retain that designation. The nomenclature will
remain the same on that clock as it's displayed here in
the control center and the nomenclature on the clock which
will be displaying the actual <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> will remain TB5. To repeat
that again, recognizing that it's probably a bit confusing.
The nomenclatures on the clocks will remain the same, however,
what they're displaying will be changed. The clock that
is designated <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> will actually be referred to here in the
control center as the PET clock, the phase elapsed time
clock, however, the nomenclature on it, as we understand now
will not be changed. It will remain fixed as the <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> clock
and the nomenclature on the TB5 clock will also remain TB5,
however, it will be counting actual ground elapsed time,
the total time since lift off. The rational for the update
to the clocks is roughly as follows: of course, launching
40 minutes late without changing the amount of energy that
was put into the trajectory by the translunar injection
maneuver with the Saturn third stage, we would have arrived
at the Moon 40 minutes late. However, the translunar coast
phase is in many respects like a big sponge.  You can squeeze
things out of it or you can put things into it, use it to
absorb time differences. In this case the translunar injection
the proper <a href="acron.html#deltav"><font color=#206020>Delta-V</font></a>, the proper velocity was added to put us
into lunar orbit at the same sun time or greenwich mean time
as the flight plan called for. The sun time on arrival will
then will be the same as it was originally
planned to be in the flight plan. And mission events will
occur in the same sequence after lunar orbit insertion
as the flight plan called for. In order to make the flight
plan agree with the sun time and the greenwich mean time,
it will be updated 40 minutes. The clock will be moved
ahead 40 minutes so that the phase elapse time, which is
used as a reference to the flight will agree with the
flight plan. The alternative to this would be to update
the flight plan by 40 minutes making numerous changes to
the flight plan in pencil both here on the ground and by
the crew. To circumvent this problem the clocks themselves
will be changed recognizing that the clocks are in fact,
the <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a> clock is in some senses an arbitrary time reference
which allows us to reference time to the flight plan. The
crew was advised that this will occur at about 54 hours as
planned in the flight plan.
<p>
At the present time Apollo 14
is traveling at a velocity of 4,536 feet per second [1,383 m/s] and the
spacecraft is 115,742 nautical miles [214,354 km] from Earth. The
mid-course correction number 2 is scheduled to occur at
30 hours, 36 minutes, 7 seconds ground elapsed time. The
velocity change in that maneuver which will be performed with
the spacecraft service propulsion system engine, will be
71.4 feet per second [21.8 m/s]. And it will change the spacecraft
approach to the Moon - the point of closest approach from
the current distance of about 2,104 nautical miles [3,897 km] down to
the planned 60 nautical miles [111 km] perigee or perilune. The burn
will be a 10 second maneuver. A 10 second burn with the
service propulsion system engine. The spacecraft at the
time of the maneuver will be oriented with it's engine bell
pointed in the direction of travel, about 66 feet per second [20 m/s]
of the burn will be in the direction pointing back to Earth
or in other words it will be radial or radial component and
25 feet per second [8 m/s] - there will be a 25 foot per second
component which is retrograde or in the easterly direction.
The total composite <a href="acron.html#deltav"><font color=#206020>Delta-V</font></a>, as I said will be 71.4 feet
per second [21.8 m/s]. At 29 hours, 34 minutes, this Apollo Control,

[It's not easy explaining some of the more complicated aspects of rocket science to the general
public, especially if you have to do it live.
The Apollo 14 mission had been meticulously planned to arrive at the Moon at a certain date and time.
Rather than making a long series of small adjustments to the plan to account for the late start,
<a href="acron.html#fido"><font color=#202060>FIDO</font></a> (flight dynamics officer) and his team decided to have the spacecraft
fly a little faster in order to arrive at exactly the preplanned time.
<p>
However, one change needed to be made.  All planning for an Apollo mission is based on the
Ground Elapsed Time or <a href="info.html#get"><a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#202060>GET</font></a></a> which is usually just a measure of the
time that has elapsed since launch.  However since the spacecraft will now arrive 40 minutes and
3 seconds sooner after launch than planned, the <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#202060>GET</font></a> will have to be advanced by this amount
to made sure that they arrive at the exactly the <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#202060>GET</font></a> time that is listed in their flight plan.
By "big sponge", the PAO meant the 50 hour long, low speed coast period between the MCC-2 and
the entry into lunar orbit.  A small change in the spacecraft's velocity can have a big
effect on how long it takes to reach the Moon.]</blockquote>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 30 hours, 6 minutes
Apollo 14 at this time is 117,213 nautical miles [217,078 km] from Earth.
The spacecraft velocity is 4,483 feet per second [1,366 m/s]. About 2
hours ago an auspicious event slipped by unnoticed as the
spacecraft passed the half way mark in terms of total mileage
or in terms of mileage to the Moon I guess we should say.
At 27 hours, 4 minutes, 42 seconds Apollo 14 was 109,172
nautical miles [202,187 km] from Earth or half way between Earth and the
Moon. The spacecraft velocity at that point was 4,779 feet
per second [1,457 m/s]. We'll cross the half way point in time on the
trip to the Moon at 40 hours, 56 minutes. Both the distance
and the time half way point are dependent upon a normal
midcourse correction 2. Should that MCC-2 maneuver which is
scheduled to be performed in a little less than 30 minutes
give us different values it will of course change the total
distance by some small amount. The Flight Dynamics Officer
has also computed a new set of coordinates and a new time
for the arrival of the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> at the lunar surface. The
impact is schedule to occur at a ground elapsed time of
82 hours, 38 minutes, 3 seconds and our new set of coordinates
are as follows. The latitude of the impact point now appears
to be at 9 degrees, 32 minutes south. The longitude 26 degrees,
20 minutes west. What we're seeing is a gradual shift of
the impact point slightly to the west and moving a bit closer
to the Apollo 12 seismometer. Again to repeat the information
on the scheduled midcourse correction which is
occurring at the second midcourse correction opportunity.
It will be the first midcourse. The burn is scheduled to
occur at 30 hours, 36 minutes, 7 seconds ground elapsed time.
The burn duration will be 10 seconds. It will be performed
with the service propulsion system engine giving a total
velocity change of 71.4 feet per second [21.8 m/s]. The bulk of that
velocity change will be in a radial direction or back towards
Earth. And the affect of the maneuver will be to bulge the
trajectory slightly so that the spacecraft arrives at the
Moon a little later and
also at the planned altitude of 60 nautical miles [111 km].
Without the burn the spacecraft would pass by the Moon at
an altitude of 21 hundred 4 nautical miles [3,897 km], and it would
arrive 40 minutes earlier. With the burn, it places the
arrival time back 40 minutes to coincide with the ground
elapsed time, and the Greenwich mean time. Correction
on that, the time of arrival is fixed by the cutout conditions
of the trans lunar injection, and the midcourse correction
burn, taking into account the fact that we will be arriving
at the Moon at the planned Greenwich mean time. We'll
depress the trajectory so that the fly by the Moon, prior
to going into lunar orbit is at 60 nautical miles [111 km]. And we're
now 25 minutes, 54 seconds away from that midcourse correction
maneuver. The maneuver in addition to lowering the distance
at which the spacecraft passes by the Moon, will also remove
the spacecraft from a free return trajectory in at least
one sense, and that is that, following the burn it will no longer
be possible to reenter the Earth's atmosphere in the
proper entry corridor using only <a href="acron.html#rcs"><font color=#206020>RCS</font></a> propulsion capabilities.
Once this midcourse correction has been performed, in order
to enter the entry corridor properly, it will require either
the, either subsequent midcourse corrections using the
<a href="acron.html#sps"><font color=#206020>SPS</font></a> engine, or the descent propulsion system engine on the
lunar module. At 30 hours, 11 minutes, this is Apollo Control

combination <a href="acron.html#csm">CSM</a>/<a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>, and then redo P40, you'll get better agreement with the

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 30 hours,
17 minutes. We now show the spacecraft to be in the
proper attitude for the midcourse correction. I would like
to go back over one point that perhaps got a bit garbled in
the last report, and that is the effects of this maneuver on
the trajectory. Without the burn, without the midcourse
correction, the spacecraft, as we said would pass about
21 hundred 4 nautical miles [3,897 km] from the Moon. Also, its
time of closest approach would be about 15 minutes later
than desired. With the midcourse correction we place
the time of approach at the time desired, which is 82 hours
0 minutes 37 seconds. That'll be the time of closest approach
with no further maneuvers, and we'll lower the point of
closest approach from the 21 hundred 4 nautical miles [3,897 km] to 60.3
nautical miles [111.7 km]. We're now about 17
minutes, 30 seconds away from that midcourse correction

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 31 hours,
42 minutes. The Apollo 14 crew has completed the dim light
photography scheduled in the flight plan. The next event
will be to stabilize the spacecraft and then spin it up at
the relatively slow rotational rate of 3 revolutions per hour.
This is the passive thermal control mode used to maintain the
proper thermal stability, the proper temperatures of the
spacecraft exposing all sides of the spacecraft equally to
the radiation from the sun. At the present time we show
Apollo 14 121,264 nautical miles [224,581 km] from Earth traveling at a
velocity of 4,271 feet per second [1,302 m/s]. The preliminary data from
that midcourse correction maneuver performed at 30 hours, 36
minutes, 7 seconds, as called for in the flight plan, as with
the delta V gained the velocity resulting from the maneuver
was 71.4 feet per second [21.8 m/s]. And the preliminary tracking data
shows that the maneuver had the effect of lowering the point
of closest approach to the Moon from 2,104 nautical miles [3,897 km] to
67.05. The maneuver was targeted to lower the point of closest
approach to about 60 nautical miles [111 km]. And the Flight Dynamics
Officer reports that with additional tracking, we expect the
data to show that we came very close to that. The burn was
almost precisely normal as planned. The burn duration had
been targeted for about 10.3 seconds, and on the ground we
measured the burn time at 10 seconds. Of course the guidance
system on the spacecraft is designed to shut down the engine,
based on the amount of velocity gained rather then the time
of the maneuver rather then the time of burn so that it is
perfectly consistent for the guidance system to shut down
within a fraction of a second of the pre-computed time based
on the amount of energy that is gotten from the engine at
any particular maneuver. During the burn and for about 1 hour
before, Louise Mitchell, wife of Lunar Module Pilot Edgar Mitchell,
was in the control center viewing the procedures. We don't
have a great deal of activity scheduled on the flight plan
now. The Astronauts are scheduled to get another sleep period
at 41 hours or about 9 hours, 15 minutes from now. During
that interim period of time primary activities will be systems
monitoring and such things as charging batteries, venting the
batteries, and of course setting up the passive thermal control
mode which will be beginning soon. Earlier this evening, we
again talked with the crew about the condition and the events
preceding and leading up to the docking operation and the
condition of the probe assembly. Following the crews answering
some additional questions about the probe assembly, They
were advised that the probe appears to be normal and that we
will continue with the normal flight plan leading up to a
landing on the Moon, as things stand right now.
The Saturn third stage, the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a>,
based on our last computations will impact the Moon at
82 hours, 38 minutes and 3 seconds, at a latitude of 9 degrees
32 minutes south, longitude 26 degrees 20 minutes
west and as we continue to gather more tracking data, these
numbers have been changing and we expect that they will
continue to change somewhat. At 31 minutes, 47 seconds,
this is rather 31 hours, 47 minutes, this is Apollo Control.<p>
