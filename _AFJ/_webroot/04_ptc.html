<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 9 minutes. We've completed our shift handover now at mission control. Flight director, Milton Windler, and his team of maroon flight directors, flight controllers. The flight dynamics officer has just advised the flight director that he does not anticipate a mid-course correction being required at the opportunity for mid-course correction 1. This would mean that the mid-course would not be made until the midcourse correction 2 opportunity. At the present time Apollo 14 is traveling at a speed of 11,237 feet per second [3,425 m/s]. The spacecraft altitude is 28,593 nautical miles [52,954 km]. There will be a change of shift briefing in about 30 minutes. The briefing will be held in the large auditorium in the MSC news center in Building 1.</div>
<div><b>006:09:47 Roosa:</b> Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>006:09:50 Fullerton:</b> Go ahead. Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>006:09:52 Roosa:</b> Okay, Gordon. I'm sure - sure you all have been - been talking about it. Do you want me to press ahead with the maneuver to the <a href="acron.html#p52">P52</a> attitude and go into that?</div>
<div><b>006:10:04 Fullerton:</b> Roger, Stu. That's affirmative. We'd like you to go through with the normal procedures as shown in the flight plan down to that <a href="acron.html#p52">P52</a> at 5 hours and 40 minutes, but at that point we're going to deviate slightly in order to save some <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a>. We do not want you to do the fuel cell purge or the waste water dump. We're planning to have you - or - or - and we do not want you to do the - go into <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a>. At that point we're planning to do the P23 which will be a little early, and we'll have a new attitude for that. And then we'll go into <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a>. Right now it looks like midcourse 1 is likely to be necessary, so that we'll save one <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> spinup. That way we'll save some <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a>. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:10:56 Roosa:</b> Okay, now at 5:50 you say, do not do the fuel cell purge or the waste water dump?</div>
<div><b>006:11:03 Fullerton:</b> That's affirmative, Stu.</div>
<div><b>006:11:06 Roosa:</b> Okay, we won't do it.</div>
<div class="comment">Long comm break.</div>
<div><b>006:16:13 Fullerton:</b> 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>006:16:15 Mitchell:</b> Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>006:16:16 Fullerton:</b> Roger. As soon as you get to your attitude there, we're ready to uplink a new <a href="acron.html#refsmmat">REFSMMAT</a> to you.</div>
<div><b>006:16:23 Mitchell:</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>006:18:40 Mitchell:</b> Houston, 14. Do you want me to start a battery B charge ?</div>
<div><b>006:18:44 Fullerton:</b> Stand by, Ed. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:19:05 Fullerton:</b> Ed, that's affirmative. Go ahead with the battery B charge.</div>
<div><b>006:19:08 Mitchell:</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="comment">Long comm break.</div>
<div><b>006:22:45 Roosa:</b> Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>006:22:52 Fullerton:</b> Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>006:22:53 Roosa:</b> Hey, Gordon. I can - got a beautiful view of <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> now, out of the left-hand window, and she's stable as a rock.</div>
<div><b>006:23:03 Fullerton:</b> Roger, Stu. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:23:14 Mitchell:</b> And, Houston, I've initiated battery B charge.</div>
<div><b>006:23:18 Fullerton:</b> Roger, Ed. Would you give us Omni Charlie, Ed?</div>
<div><b>006:23:28 Fullerton:</b> You have it.</div>
<div><b>006:23:30 Fullerton:</b> Roger. And at about 6:25:20 the LOX dump should start on the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a>. You might keep an eye on it at that time. I'll give you a warning about 10 seconds prior.</div>
<div><b>006:23:43 Mitchell:</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div class="pao">Capcom, Gordon Fullerton, was advising the crew that the dump of liquid oxygen remaining in the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> will occur at 6 hours, 25 minutes, 20 seconds ground elapsed time. This is the propulsive venting of the liquid oxygen which is aimed to increase the separation distance between the lunar module and the booster third stage and also is targeted to impact the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> on the lunar surface near the Apollo 12 seismometer. We're now at 6 hours, 25 minutes, 20 seconds away from the liquid oxygen dump.</div>
<div><b>006:25:08 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 14, Houston. That LOX dump should start in about 10 seconds.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div class="pao">Booster reports the dump is initiated.</div>
<div><b>006:26:18 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 14, Houston. The LOX dump should be complete now. Did you see anything of it?</div>
<div><b>006:26:24 Shepard:</b> Yes. It's a beautiful sight, Houston. The sun was shining from the side; it was streaming out. We tried to get a couple of Hasselblad shots of it from the corner of the window. It was really fantastic.</div>
<div><b>006:26:38 Fullerton:</b> Roger, Al. [Long pause]<p>
<div class="pao">That was Apollo 14 commander, Al Shepard reporting a very spectacular sight with good sunlight on the liquid oxygen particles streaming out of the nozzle of the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a>. The launch dump is scheduled to be followed by an additional ...</div>
<div><b>006:27:01 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Houston. You have <a href="acron.html#p00">P00</a> and Accept.</div>
<div><b>006:27:04 Fullerton:</b> Roger. And we'd like you to try to bring up the High Gain now. Use a Pitch of plus 28 and a Yaw of plus 317. Over.</div>
<div><b>006:27:19 Mitchell:</b> Roger. 28 and 317. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:27:35 Mitchell:</b> Okay. You're in Auto and locked up, Houston.</div>
<div><b>006:27:39 Fullerton:</b> Roger. [Long pause]<p>
<div class="pao">Once the high gain antenna is brought into play, we should see a marked increase in signal strength. The launch dump from the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> will be followed by an additional maneuver to target the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> to the proper impact point. That maneuver, performed with the auxiliary propulsion system.</div>
<div><b>006:28:08 Fullerton:</b> Ed, this is Houston. We're having a little problem with our read-out of high-gain-antenna angles here. Would you read out your onboard pitch and yaw angle?</div>
<div><b>006:28:17 Mitchell:</b> Roger. Pitch of plus 29 and Yaw of about 320 - 330.</div>
<div><b>006:28:28 Fullerton:</b> Say again the Yaw.</div>
<div><b>006:28:31 Mitchell:</b> About 330.</div>
<div><b>006:28:32 Fullerton:</b> 330. Roger.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>006:29:01 Mitchell (onboard):</b> I'm not either, Al.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>006:29:06 Shepard (onboard):</b> How are you doing, Stu?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>006:29:07 Roosa (onboard):</b> Well, so far, so good.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>006:29:09 Shepard (onboard):</b> Really very comfortable.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>006:29:11 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes, I - I guess I'm a little surprised at - at the fighting to stay down ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>006:29:17 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>006:29:18 Roosa (onboard):</b> ... if any.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>006:29:19 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Well, I think a lot of this is due to these hoses we got on here. Once we get rid of them, it'll be a little different.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>006:29:25 Roosa (onboard):</b> There are a jillion stars out there.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>006:29:28 Mitchell (onboard):</b> I think you've got a whole bunch of little things to look at.</div>

<div><b>006:30:46 Mitchell:</b> Okay.<div class="comment">Very long comm break.</div>
<div class="pao">This is Apollo control at 6 hours, 33 minutes. We'll be coming up soon on a change of shift press briefing. At that time we will take down the live air to ground circuits and record any conversation with the spacecraft for playback following the change of shift briefing. One bit of information from the flight surgeon. The flight surgeon reports that Commander Shepherd's biomedical data, primarily heart rate, resumed spontaneously at 1 hour, 30 minutes ground elapsed time. At that time, the capcom asked if he did anything to fix the sensor and Shepherd replied nope. The readings on all three crewmen during the docking attempts are approximately as follows. During most of the unsuccessful attempts Stu Roosa, who was piloting the command module at that time, had a heart rate of about 120 beats per minute. The other two crewmen, Shepherd and Mitchell, were averaging around 70 beats per minute. And during the final successful docking attempt, Roosa's heart rate went from 120 to 144. At the present time the Apollo 14 crew is performing a program 52. This is a platform alinement. The spacecraft traveling at a velocity of 10,739 feet per second [3,273 m/s] and now at a distance of 31,236 nautical miles [57,849 km] from Earth.</div>
<div><b>006:41:24 Mitchell:</b> Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>006:41:34 Mitchell:</b> Houston, Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>006:41:38 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 14, Houston. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>006:41:40 Mitchell:</b> Roger. Did you get our Noun 93s?</div>
<div><b>006:41:45 Fullerton:</b> That's affirmative. We copied them.</div>
<div><b>006:41:47 Mitchell:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>006:41:53 Fullerton:</b> Ed, would you give us the torquing time?</div>
<div><b>006:41:57 Mitchell:</b> Roger. 006:40:35.</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo control at 6 hours, 45 minutes. At the present time Apollo 14 is traveling at a speed of 10,555 feet per second [3,217 m/s] and at a distance of 32,283 nautical miles [59,788 km] from Earth. Change of shift briefing is ready to begin now in the MSC News Center. We'll record any conversation with the spacecraft during this period of time and play them back following the press briefing. Also there will be questions from Cape Kennedy following the briefing during the course of the question and answer period. At 6 hours, 46 minutes, this is Apollo control."</div>
<div><div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 7 hours, 25 minutes. During the change of shift briefing, we advised the crew that it is being considered to have them remove the probe and drogue assembly from the docking tunnel, pull it down into the command module and activate the television so that we on the ground and the crew can get a good look at that particular piece of equipment. A decision to do so will not be made in all probability for another 30 to 40 minutes. At that time it will then require something like an additional two hours to get the necessary lines up between the receiving end - the receiving station at Goldstone and Houston, so the television transmission can be routed here to the control center. We'll play back the tape conversations which we have accumulated during the change of shift briefing and then continue to follow any other conversations live.</div>
<div><b>006:50:46 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 14, Houston. Over,</div>
<div><b>006:50:48 Mitchell:</b> Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>006:50:50 Fullerton:</b> Okay. If you haven't already, we'd like you to continue on through the rest of the procedures in the flight plan after the <a href="acron.html#p52">P52</a> down to 6 hours, except don't do the O<sub>2</sub>
fuel cell purge or the waste water dump.</div>
<div><b>006:51:05 Mitchell:</b> Okay. That's what we're planning to do.</div>
<div><b>006:51:07 Fullerton:</b> And, then, Ed, I have a longer update; I want you to do a P23, the one that's scheduled for about 9:50 in the flight plan - correction 9:30, and if you'd turn to that, I'll give you some new stars and other information to go then. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:51:30 Mitchell:</b> Stand by. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:52:11 Mitchell:</b> All right Houston, I have the flight plan open to 09:30.</div>
<div><b>006:52:17 Fullerton:</b> Roger. Stand by 1. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:52:34 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Ed. On the P23, the optics Cal attitude is the same as listed there. Like you to change the P23 sighting attitude to roll, 184; pitch, 2 -- [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:52:52 Mitchell:</b> Hold it, hold it.</div>
<div><b>006:52:54 Fullerton:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>006:52:55 Mitchell:</b> Okay. I'm ready; go again.</div>
<div><b>006:52:57 Fullerton:</b> Okay. It's listed there at 42. Roll, 184; pitch, 283; and yaw, 310. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:53:11 Mitchell:</b> Okay. The sighting attitude is 184, 283, 310.</div>
<div><b>006:53:17 Fullerton:</b> That's right. And we have a change in the order of doing the stars, plus a couple of substitutions. I'd like you to use the listed star number 3, that's Gamma Centauri, number 53. I want you to do that star first. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:53:38 Mitchell:</b> Hold it a minute.</div>
<div><b>006:53:47 Mitchell:</b> Okay, 53, Gamma Centauri is first.</div>
<div><b>006:53:50 Fullerton:</b> Roger. And then the star that's listed number 2, number 236, will be the second star.</div>
<div><b>006:54:00 Mitchell:</b> Roger. Delta Ophiuchi.</div>
<div><b>006:54:03 Fullerton:</b> Okay. And then the third star is a different one, a new one. It will be star 161, Iota Centauri - and Earth far horizon. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:54:27 Mitchell:</b> Okay, star 3 is 161, Iota Centauri, <a href="acron.html#efh">EFH</a>.</div>
<div><b>006:54:34 Fullerton:</b> Roger. The Noun 70 for that star is the same as the Noun 70 on star number 1. It ought to be easy just to write it down. That'll be 00 all balls on the first register, all balls on the second register, and 00120 on the third register. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:54:58 Mitchell:</b> Understand.</div>
<div><b>006:55:00 Fullerton:</b> And Noun 88 is completely different. First register, minus 75603; second register, minus 27129; and third register, minus 59566. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:55:34 Mitchell:</b> Roger, stand by a minute. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:56:01 Mitchell:</b> Okay. For Iota Centauri, Noun 70 is all zeroes, all zeroes, 00120; Noun 88; minus 75603, minus 27129, minus 59566. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:56:24 Fullerton:</b> Roger, Ed. Readback correct. Okay, the fourth star will be star number 24, Gienah, Earth's far horizon. And Noun 70 will be first register, 00024; second register, all balls; third register, 00120; and you don't need a Noun 88 for that one. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:57:13 Mitchell:</b> Okay. The fourth star is 24, Gienah, <a href="acron.html#efh">EFH</a>; Noun 70 is 00024, all zeroes, and 00120.</div>
<div><b>006:57:26 Fullerton:</b> Roger. That readback's good. After you finish that P23, we'd like you to do the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and the waste water dump. And then the - the activity to follow is still under discussion here; we're talking over possibly removing the drogue and taking a look at it at that time and possibly cranking up the TV to give us a picture of it back here. So the decision to start <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> after finishing the P23 will depend on whether we're going to request you to give us a TV shot of the drogue and probe. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:58:10 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Understand, and the - following the P23, you want us to press on with the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste water dump that's listed about 11:25. Is that correct?</div>
<div><b>006:58:23 Fullerton:</b> I guess it's listed there, and it's also the same thing you skipped back there at 5 hours and 55 minutes. I guess ...</div>
<div><b>006:58:37 Mitchell:</b> Do you want us to do it immediately after the P23, or wait until 11:25.</div>
<div><b>006:58:45 Fullerton:</b> Roger. Stand by. I'll check on that to be sure. Do that immediately after the P23, Ed.</div>
<div><b>006:58:55 Mitchell:</b> Roger.</div>
<div><b>006:58:58 Fullerton:</b> One other thing, while you have a pencil in hand, is a lift-off plus 15 P37 block data when you're ready.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>007:00:56 Mitchell:</b> Houston, go ahead with the P37 for lift-off plus 15.</div>
<div><b>007:01:00 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Ed. <a href="acron.html#get">GET</a> of ignition is 015:00; <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a><sub>T</sub>, 5700, minus 165; <a href="acron.html#get">GET</a>
for 400K, 045:04. Go ahead. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>007:01:23 Mitchell:</b> Okay. <a href="acron.html#get">GET</a> is 015:00; 5700, minus 165; 045:04. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>007:01:37 Fullerton:</b> Roger, Ed. Your readback's good.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>007:02:45 Mitchell:</b> Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>007:02:47 Fullerton:</b> Go ahead, Ed.</div>
<div><b>007:02:56 Fullerton:</b> 14, Houston; go ahead.</div>
<div><b>007:02:59 Mitchell:</b> Roger, Gordon. We didn't quite understand when you wanted us to start this P23 that you passed the info on.</div>
<div><b>007:03:08 Fullerton:</b> Right now, whenever you're ready.</div>
<div><b>007:03:12 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Stu's going to get out of his suit here, and we'll be ready in a few minutes.</div>
<div><b>007:03:16 Fullerton:</b> Roger.<div class="comment">Very long comm break.</div>
<div><b>007:15:26 Shepard:</b> All right, Houston; 14. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>007:15:32 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 14, Houston. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>007:15:33 Shepard:</b> Okay, Gordon, I just wanted to check and make sure that I was back on the comm here.</div>
<div><b>007:15:39 Fullerton:</b> Roger, loud and clear.<div class="comment">Very long comm break.</div>
<div><b>007:29:14 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>007:29:18 Roosa:</b> Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>007:29:20 Fullerton:</b> Roger, Stu. When you get ready to commence your P23, we have a change to the sighting attitude, based on your current estimated time of starting. Over.</div>
<div><b>007:29:33 Roosa:</b> Okay. And, hey, could you give me an estimate on - on this? Are you wanting us to press on into that right now, or do you want us to go ahead and get the suits stowed, so forth?</div>
<div><b>007:29:43 Fullerton:</b> That's really your option, Stu. Whenever you conveniently get ready to run a P23, why don't you check with us, and we'll make sure you've got a current attitude? Over.</div>
<div><b>007:29:56 Roosa:</b> Okay.<div class="comment">Very long comm break.</div>
<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 7 hours, 38 minutes. That completes the playback of the taped conversations between the spacecraft and Mission Control. We'll now continue to follow for any live conversation with the crew. The capsule communicator at this time: is astronaut Bruce McCandless. McCandless relieved capcom Gordon Fullerton. At the present time, Apollo 14 is traveling a velocity of 9,776 feet per second [2,980 m/s] and the spacecraft is 37,248 nautical miles [68,983 km] from Earth.</div>
<div><b>007:45:09 Roosa:</b> Okay, Bruce. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>007:45:14 McCandless:</b> Go ahead. Apollo 14, this is Houston. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>007:45:22 Roosa:</b> Okay, Houston. I'm getting ready to start this P23, and - and I guess that last <a href="acron.html#p52">P52</a> will still be good for this, and I'll start into the optics Cal attitude and then get your Verb 49 attitude to start after that.</div>
<div><b>007:45:41 McCandless:</b> Okay. And I'll check and see if we want to update our attitude from the one I got here in front of me, and we'll pass it up to you when you're ready.</div>
<div><b>007:45:52 Roosa:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>007:46:02 Roosa:</b> And, Bruce, I guess I want to verify we do not need another <a href="acron.html#p52">P52</a>. It's been - what - an hour since that last one?</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 8 hours, 12 minutes. At the present time, the crew aboard Apollo 14 is preparing to begin a series of star sightings. They will do this in computer program 23. Taking sightings and marks on 3 stars to update the onboard guidance systems knowledge of where it is and where it is going. At this time here in Houston at the Manned Spacecraft Center and also at North American and Downing, California. Teams of engineers are in the process of putting together a set of procedures and evaluating the tests involved in running through a set of checks on the probe and drogue assembly on board the spacecraft. Once this set of procedures is worked out, and the flight director and team of flight controllers here in mission control had a chance to evaluate them, a decision will be made as to whether or not to attempt at removing the probe and drogue assembly and also bringing up the television to transmit television pictures of the evaluation back to Earth. Once that decision is made, it is estimated that it will take about 2 hours to get the lines up between Goldstone and Houston so that we can receive the television picture. Now, we still have some 3 hours, 50 minutes of acquisition time remaining at Goldstone before a handover is made to the Honeysuckle station. The estimate is that it will probably take on the order of 6 hours time to get circuits up between Honeysuckle and MSC to allow transmission of television from Honeysuckle to here. And, more than likely, any television received at Honeysuckle would be recorded for later playback and would not be transmitted live to Houston. However, the plan would be to transmit television live from Goldstone some 2 hours after a decision to remove probe and drogue was made. Best estimate on when that decision might be made is it will probably be no sooner than 30 to 40 minutes. We'll keep you advised on any changes in that. At 8 hours, 15 minutes this is Apollo Control."</div>
<div><div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 8 hours, 30 minutes. Apollo 14 traveling at 9,163 feet per second [2,793 m/s]. Spacecraft is 41,842 nautical miles [77,491 km] from Earth. The Flight Dynamics Officer reported that there appears to be a very small amount of venting occurring on the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a>. The venting is not probably causing any significant affect to the trajectory to the vehicle, however, it does affect the tracking data on it, and makes it difficult for the Flight Dynamics Officer to get a good vector on the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> and from that to compute a predicted impact point. However, it is possible to compute the impact point based on the known position at the time the last propulsive maneuver occurred the last dump from that to compute an impact point. Based on the Flight Dynamics Officers computed impact point the booster Officer will compute a needed <a href="acron.html#deltav"><font color=#206020>Delta-V</font></a>

<div class="pao">That last remark came from Al Shepard. Shepard stated that the crew would not mind removing the probe and drogue assembly tonight, but they would prefer not to have to reinstall it tonight before beginning their sleep period. And as you heard, capcom, Bruce McCandless advised the crew that the decision has not as yet been made as to whether or not the crew will be asked to remove the drogue and probe assembly. Discussions are going on at this moment around the flight director's console and we're still awaiting the engineering data which will also serve in part in making that decision.

<div><b>009:34:08 Shepard:</b> Houston, on the <a href="acron.html#ems">EMS</a> null bias check, we had start at minus 100 and terminate with minus 99.4.</div>

<div><b>009:35:03 Shepard:</b> [Garbled] the drogue, Bruce, is to get it out, look at it, discuss it with you, and give you some time to think about it, and tie it down here with us while you're thinking about it.</div>
<div><b>009:35:15 McCandless:</b> Roger. We're tentatively looking at taking the probe out, doing that, tying it down, and we may want to take the drogue out, but we thought you could just lock the drogue back in place, and then the hatch, to go to sleep for the evening.</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 39 minutes. The decision that's been made with respect to the drogue and probe is that the crew will be asked to remove the assembly. They will also be asked to unstow the television camera, get television coverage of it. However, the television lines will not be put up between Goldstone and Houston in order to avoid a 2 hours delay of the TV signal would be recorded at Goldstone for playback later. And the evaluation that would be done this evening would be a verbal evaluation from the crew with the TV to be recorded for playback at some later time. At 9 hours, 40 minutes Apollo 14 is travelling at a speed of 8,438 feet [2,572 m]: per second, now 47,557 nautical miles [88,076 km] from Earth."</div>
<div><div class="pao"> This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 42 minutes. There has been a slight modification to that plan as far as the TV is concerned. The crew will begin as soon as convenient to remove the probe and drogue assembly, however the lines will be brought up from Goldstone. This will probably require an hour to an hour and a half and any television that is received at the time the lines are up will be released live. Any television kilowatt time will be recorded. So there is a possibility that we will get some live television toward the end of the probe and drogue activities aboard the Command Module. And the network controller is taking steps now to get those lines up between Houston and Goldstone. The estimate is that it will take, at this point, an hour and a half or perhaps a little longer.</div>
<div><b>009:44:15 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston. We're showing about 15 percent on waste water on telemetry now.</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 53 minutes. Here in Mission Control we're proceeding with preparation for the removal and evaluation of the probe and drogue assembly aboard the spacecraft. A probe and drogue have been brought into the control center and will be used in directing the crew and in familiarizing flight controllers with the various aspects of the probe and drogue assembly that will be discussed. Capsule communicator, Bruce McCandless has the assembly sitting near the base of his console and will use the assembly to direct the crew to perform the tasks that will be asked of them and discussing various aspects of the assembly. Again, to repeat the plan as far as television coverage of this activity is concerned the crew will remove the, actually they will vent the tunnel between the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> and the Command Module first and then remove the command module hatch, activating a handle on the probe assembly which will collapse the assembly and allow it to be removed from the tunnel. And finally removing the drogue, is required. This whole operation requires on the order of 15 to 20 minutes and will be followed by detailed examination with questions prepared in the engineering support room here at the Manned Spacecraft Center and passed up to the crew for their response. We have about 2 hours and 8 minutes of acquisition time remaining at Goldstone. It is estimated that it will require about an hour, perhaps and hour and a half to get the lines up between Goldstone and Houston so that we can receive live television. The crew will be instructed to install the television camera and television pictures will be recorded until such time the lines between Houston and Goldstone are up. At that time we will receive live television transmission. Following the completion of the evaluation of the Drogue and probe assembly we will play back the recorded television. At 9 hours, 56 minutes, Apollo 14 is 48,956 nautical miles [90,667 km] from Earth traveling at a speed of 8,369 feet per second [2,551 m/s].</div>

<div><b>009:57:26 McCandless:</b> Okay, Ed. Here is what we would like to do on the probe removal - or actually the whole probe inspection shooting match. We'd like to remove the tunnel hatch, of course, and let you make a quick visual inspection there to see if there is anything that looks significantly amiss. If you see anything, we'd like to photograph it; and, in this whole sequence, we would like to have you power up the television and send a picture down, which we'll receive at - at Goldstone and record. Although we still have about an hour or an hour and a half before we can be configured to receive the television back here live, and then pressing on from there, if you want to make a couple of notes on a pad, we'd like you to perform the probe removal in accordance with the decal with the following exception.

<div><b>010:02:24 McCandless:</b> Roger. Actually we'll be looking at page S2-6 for the changes, that is, the section that applies to both TLD and LOD. Over.</div>
<div><b>010:02:35 Mitchell:</b> Okay, I'm ready to copy.</div>
<div><b>010:02:38 McCandless:</b> Okay. At the top of page 2-6, the first step, "Probe umbilicals" - disconnect and stow. We'd like you to verify proper connection of the umbilicals before you disconnect and stow them. And I guess you might take a look for bent pins, contacts, and all sort of stuff. Down - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - at about the sixth line down where it says "Capture latch release handle lock - rotate counterclockwise to unlock." We'd like you to verify that it is locked prior to unlocking it. You got that one? [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>010:03:25 Mitchell:</b> Okay, go ahead.</div>
<div><b>010:03:27 McCandless:</b> Down about five lines further, we have "Capture latch release handle - pull, rotate to unlock, 180 clockwise," and we'd like you to pay particular attention to whether there is unusually high torque required to unlock the capture latch release handle in this step. And we'd also like you to verify the absence of, or report, any damage to the pyro cover or to the capture latch release handle. And the pyro cover that we are talking about is the - it looks like an extruded metallic shell just forward of the capture latch release handle there. It's the one that bears the decals on it that say, "cock" and "unlock." Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>010:04:33 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Damage to the pyro cover and what else?</div>
<div><b>010:04:36 McCandless:</b> Any damage to the capture latch release handle? And then as you pull it out, we'd like to know if you notice any unusual forces required to remove the probe. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>010:05:00 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Let me read it back.</div>
<div><b>010:05:02 McCandless:</b> Okay, go ahead.</div>
<div><b>010:05:04 Mitchell:</b> At top of page S2-6, "Probe umbilicals." Before we disconnect and stow, we want to verify that the "yea verilies" are properly connected.</div>
<div><b>010:05:14 McCandless:</b> Yea, verily.</div>
<div><b>010:05:17 Mitchell:</b> And there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 "Capture latch release handle lock"; before rotating counterclockwise to unlock, I want to verify again that that is locked.</div>
<div><b>010:05:30 McCandless:</b> Roger.</div>
<div><b>010:05:31 Mitchell:</b> And that you would like for us to pay attention to the torque required to loosen any of these items - oh, that's the capture latch release handle; and you want us to observe for any damage to the pyro cover or the capture latch release handle and to observe any obvious damage that's apparent to the capture latches or the probe end.</div>
<div><b>010:05:54 McCandless:</b> Roger, Ed. And we currently have the lines from Goldstone back to the building up here, so I think that we'll probably be ready to support via TV almost in real time. And for onboard photography, we're recommending use of the electric Hasselblad set on f/2.8, 1/125th of a second at 3-1/2 feet, magazine O for Okmulgee, which is stowed in Alfa 13, and you might verify the f-stop with the spotmeter set at ASA 64, if you have the chance. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>010:07:10 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Bruce. I got that, I believe. The electric Hasselblad at 2 8, 125th, 3.5, magazine O for Opinaka [?], it's stored A-13, and we'll check it with the spotmeter. How long will you have Goldstone coverage, Houston? [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>010:07:54 McCandless:</b> 14, this is Houston. We'll have Goldstone coverage for about another hour and a half. If that's any problem, we can reconfigure to pick up Honeysuckle. And the shutter speed is 1/125th; that's 1 slash 125. Over. [Long pause]</div>

<div class="comment">Long comm break.</div>
<div><b>011:22:31 Roosa:</b> Okay, Bruce; I don't know how well you can follow with the TV camera down there, but I didn't see anything obviously wrong with the umbilicals, and the capture latch release handle lock was in the Lock position.</div>
<div><b>011:22:44 McCandless:</b> Roger. Thank you, Stu.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>011:24:41 Roosa:</b> Okay. The capture latch release handle turned very easily, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>011:24:44 McCandless:</b> Roger; out.</div>
<div><b>011:24:51 McCandless:</b> You didn't notice any damage to the pyro cover or anything like that, did you?</div>
<div><b>011:24:55 Roosa:</b> No, I - I didn't, Bruce. I - I looked it over here with a flashlight and, gee, I can't - can't see anything out of the ordinary. We'll - we'll drag it down and take a look at the outside of it. But, I didn't see anything wrong with - with the pyro cover or any of the connections or anything like that.</div>
<div><b>011:25:15 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:26:07 McCandless:</b> And, Stu, while you're at it, would you say that the force that it took to remove the probe up there from the tunnel area was high, low, or indifferent - or nominal?</div>
<div><b>011:26:21 Roosa:</b> Well, you know it's the first time I've done it without gravity helping a little bit - and pushing back, but I - I wouldn't say it was exceptionally hard. I sort of braced myself on the bottom of the tunnel and gave a pull and she came loose. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:26:47 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]<p>
<div class="pao"> I can see the head of Commander Alan Shepard just behind the probe.</div>
<div><b>011:27:01 McCandless:</b> Okay. We'd like you to examine the probe head as you're now doing with particular emphasis on any evidence of unusual shearpin shearing in the bushing hole there at the end, or foreign material in the capture latch release button area or foreign material or damage anywhere in the areas of the capture latch hooks. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:27:35 Roosa:</b> Okay. We'll give it a go. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:27:55 Mitchell:</b> All right, Bruce. The first [garbled] we looked we don't see anything obvious about it.</div>
<div><b>011:28:01 McCandless:</b> Okay ...</div>
<div><b>011:28:02 Mitchell:</b> If you could give us some instructions as to where you'd like to look, we'll leave the camera right in on it for you.</div>
<div><b>011:28:07 Roosa:</b> And, Bruce, up here in the very tip of the probe - you know where the - the tower hooks on it, it looks clean. I don't see anything fishy about that right off the bat.</div>
<div><b>011:28:22 McCandless:</b> All right. Is that the bushing on the and you're describing to me, Stu?</div>
<div><b>011:28:26 Roosa:</b> Yes. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:28:46 McCandless:</b> Okay, 14, we'd like to get some closeup photos of the probe head around the capture latch release button of each capture latch hook; and if you find any scratching or damage up there - of that area in particular, also.</div>
<div><b>011:29:06 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Bruce. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:30:06 Shepard:</b> Houston, looking at the drogue, we see that there are three scratches - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - that are rough to the touch [garbled] broken the surface of the drogue. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:30:25 McCandless:</b> Al, this is Houston. You're coming through very weakly. Can you, maybe, put the mikes closer to your mouth? I think that might be the problem.</div>
<div><b>011:30:33 Shepard:</b> Okay, I was looking up and away from the mike when I was talking but, I was in the - up in the tunnel. I'm looking at the drogue and there are these radial scratches which we described before that have - that feel rough to the touch. They've probably scratched the surface of the drogue - perhaps a fourth of an inch. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:31:08 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:31:24 McCandless:</b> Al, this is Houston. You mentioned the dimension associated with these scratches - You mentioned a quarter of an inch. Was that width or depth of penetration, or length or what? Over.</div>
<div><b>011:31:38 Shepard:</b> Yes, I was trying to describe the depth of penetration, and it's very difficult because we don't have any kind of gage on it, but it has scratched the surface to a depth of perhaps - I don't know - 3 or 4 thousandths maybe. Very definitely scratched. It's just rough to the touch. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:32:05 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:32:17 MCC:</b>: Now, I'm confused, CapCom. Is that - the scratch is of 3 or 4 thousandths?</div>
<div><b>011:32:25 McCandless:</b> Okay. Understand you're saying they're about 3 or 4 thousandths of an inch deep and on the order of a couple of inches long?</div>
<div><b>011:32:32 Shepard:</b> That's right. They're very light. They all - as I said before - radial scratches leading away from the apex of the drogue and some are about 2 inches long, one's about 1 inch long, one's about three-quarters, and one's about one-half inch long. These are apparently the marks made by the capture latches as they made the docking attempt and then backed in - cut into the service of the drogue. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:33:07 McCandless:</b> Roger, we copy. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:33:31 McCandless:</b> Okay, when you get through taking some photos up there, we'd like you to take the capture latch release handle, pull, rotate it counterclockwise to the cock position and then manually depress all three capture latch triggers at the base of the capture latch hooks, simultaneously, and verify that the capture latch release button should move forward to the lock position flush with the probe hatch - bushing.</div>
<div><b>011:34:00 Roosa:</b> Okay. Why don't we do that and then when we get all through, we'll go through and get the pictures you want.</div>
<div><b>011:34:07 McCandless:</b> Roger.</div>
<div><b>011:34:10 Roosa:</b> And we're going to bring the drogue out, too, so you can take a look at it on the TV. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:34:31 McCandless:</b> Roger, Stu; and after you do get it out, we'd like you to hold the TV steady on the area of the drogue where the scratches are for a couple of minutes and do likewise again on the capture latch area of the probe.</div>
<div><b>011:34:47 Roosa:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:35:45 Roosa:</b> All right, Houston; I'm moving the television camera on the drogue now. Al's going to put a light on it. It is pretty dark.</div>
<div><b>011:35:51 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]<p>
<div class="pao"> We're now looking up into the docking tunnel towards the Lunar Module.</div>
<div><b>011:36:19 McCandless:</b> 14, this is Houston. We're getting a picture, but the illumination level isn't very good and I guess I - I for one can't see any scratches right here.</div>
<div><b>011:36:31 Roosa:</b> Roger; it is pretty hard to see it in Houston. It's the light level. We're going to try another little trick here. Let's see if we can get you some light.</div>
<div><b>011:36:48 McCandless:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:37:34 Roosa:</b> All right, Houston. We're going to move in on the - You're looking at the center of the drogue now and the scratches - you can see Stuart's thumb there. He's going to point to them and we'll see if we can get enough light for you to see them.</div>
<div><b>011:37:48 McCandless:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>011:37:55 McCandless:</b> Roger, we - we got that last one, Stu, and we got that one you're pointing at now. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:38:29 Mitchell:</b> All right, Bruce. I think that this illumination will give - illumination will give it to you if you will let me hold it for a minute here.</div>
<div><b>011:38:35 McCandless:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>011:38:44 McCandless:</b> Roger. We can see about five or six of these radial scratches in the present scene - right - right where you're looking there, about three of them. One ...</div>
<div><b>011:39:01 Roosa:</b> Yes, that's - that's affirmative, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>011:39:08 McCandless:</b> Okay, now, I guess that at the 4 o'clock position you got about three scratches and then at 8 o'clock, you've got one. Do you have anything up at noon? [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:39:29 Mitchell:</b> That's affirmative, Bruce. There's one long one at 12 o'clock noon.</div>
<div><b>011:39:34 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:39:52 Mitchell:</b> From the looks and from the feel, I believe it appears that the probe hit the drogue almost dead center every time we tried to make contact. But, it just rebounded right off of it.</div>
<div><b>011:40:07 McCandless:</b> Roger; we copy.</div>
<div><b>011:40:09 Mitchell:</b> Okay, we're going to put the drogue back in place if you're through with it now.</div>
<div><b>011:40:15 McCandless:</b> Negative, we'd like you to hold it out for a minute or so. We ultimately want to wind up fit checking the drogue and probe here.</div>
<div><b>011:40:25 McCandless:</b> Okay, back on the probe, we'd like you to take the capture latch release handle, pull, rotate counterclockwise to the Cock position or a 150-degree rotation.</div>
<div><b>011:40:37 Roosa:</b> Okay, I've done that.</div>
<div><b>011:40:41 McCandless:</b> Okay, now manually depress all three capture latch triggers at the base of the capture latch hook simultaneously and verify that the capture latch release button in the end of the probe moves forward to the Lock position; that is flush with the probe pushing.</div>
<div><b>011:41:04 Mitchell:</b> Okay, you want us to push all three of them simultaneously, is that right?</div>
<div><b>011:41:07 McCandless:</b> That's right.</div>
<div><b>011:41:12 Mitchell:</b> All right. Say it again, and verify what?</div>
<div><b>011:41:16 McCandless:</b> Okay, the little button right at the tip of the probe which is the capture latch release button from the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> active side - where you got your finger - should pop out flush when you trigger all three of these latches simultaneously.</div>
<div><b>011:41:37 Mitchell:</b> Got it. Is it flush? Okay I'm going to pull back in and it came out - it appears to be almost flush. [Garbled] count it as flush, the way it is now. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:42:26 Mitchell:</b> We're going to repeat it, Houston. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:42:52 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston. We're requesting Medium Beamwidth on the High Gain antenna and we're going to have to handover from Goldstone here shortly.</div>
<div><b>011:43:04 Roosa:</b> [Garbled] we repeated that, and it - it comes out - flush.</div>
<div><b>011:43:11 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:43:23 McCandless:</b> In looking at that button , do you notice anything unusual about it - any burrs, any bending, or any way it could be hanging up on something?</div>
<div><b>011:43:36 Unknown crew member:</b> [Garbled.]</div>
<div><b>011:43:40 McCandless:</b> Say again, Ed. We had some static.</div>
<div><b>011:43:46 Mitchell:</b> Stand by. We are looking at it now.</div>
<div><b>011:43:47 Roosa:</b> Al's taking a look at it. The top of the button looks smooth. Of course, you can't see down below it. But it seems to keep from knocking - releases fairly easily. It doesn't appear to be sticking at all.</div>
<div><b>011:44:05 McCandless:</b> Okay. I guess that's what we really wanted to know about it.</div>
<div><b>011:44:18 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston. If you could - on the TV pictures - refrain from using the flashlight in close here, I think we've got enough light to - to see it with the ambient light.</div>
<div><b>011:44:31 Mitchell:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>011:44:36 Mitchell:</b> Maybe you do. We don't seem to.</div>
<div><b>011:44:40 McCandless:</b> Okay. We got 30 seconds to handover; so we're going to just go into a standby mode here for a minute or so until Honeysuckle picks up.</div>
<div><b>011:44:48 Mitchell:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:45:22 McCandless:</b> And, Ed, now that you've got the capture latches in the Locked position out there on the end of the probe, we'd like you to push as hard as you conveniently can in zero g on each of the capture latches and verify that they do not depress.</div>
<div><b>011:45:41 Shepard:</b> All right. We've done that. We'll do it again, and they don't.</div>
<div><b>011:45:45 McCandless:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:46:04 Shepard:</b> Houston, they're not going to go in that way.</div>
<div><b>011:46:07 McCandless:</b> Okay. They shouldn't. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:46:28 McCandless:</b> Okay, 14. Now we'd like you, using tool B or some other suitable tool, to depress the capture latch release button in the end of the probe there to cock the capture latches.</div>
<div><b>011:46:43 Shepard:</b> Roger. Stand by.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div class="pao"> Our network controller reports that we are now getting a television signal from the station at Honeysuckle Creek, Australia.</div>
<div><b>011:48:32 Mitchell:</b> Houston, we can cock the capture - capture latches by pressing in the button on the end of it.</div>
<div><b>011:48:40 McCandless:</b> Roger. And now that you've got the drogue out, we'd like you to position the drogue and push it over the capture latches until the capture latch release button extends; and, I guess we'd like you to do it several times and try applying different combinations of offset, side load, and torque on the thing, and check it up for any indications of dragging, binding, or anything it might be giving the problem that you experienced a few hours ago. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:49:15 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Say again now how you would like - like us to cock the capture launches in the way we just did by depressing the button on the end of the probe. And then fitting it over - into the drogue several times and repeat this operation. Is that correct?</div>
<div><b>011:49:31 McCandless:</b> That is correct. If you put the probe in a fixed place and then put the drogue over it, you could sight in through the hole on the end of the drogue and keep a good eye on things.</div>
<div><b>011:49:44 Mitchell:</b> Roger; understand. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:49:58 McCandless:</b> 14; and, one of these times when you have the drogue on over the end of the probe, you might try just holding the drogue in position and wiggling the capture latch release button in and out several times. In this condition, it won't do anything but it will allow you to assess possibilities of binding or sticking of that particular part of the mechanism. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>011:50:26 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Houston.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>011:53:10 Mitchell:</b> Houston, I'm going to get rid of the TV camera for a minute. It's not doing us any good and it's taking all three of us to handle it.</div>
<div><b>011:53:19 McCandless:</b> Okay. Roger.</div>
<div><b>011:53:21 Mitchell:</b> And it appears we may have to get on the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> side to do this. There's not quite enough room here to work.</div>
<div><b>011:53:26 McCandless:</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>011:56:15 McCandless:</b> Ed, this is Houston. Have you had any - luck, I guess you could call it - in getting the probe and drogue to bind by applying lateral forces to the drogue?</div>
<div><b>011:56:27 Mitchell:</b> Not yet. Stand by; we're getting ready to try again now.</div>
<div><b>011:56:32 McCandless:</b> Oh, okay.</div>
<div><b>011:56:36 Mitchell:</b> Hey, Bruce, there just wasn't any place that worked handily with that. We're going to put the drogue back in - Al's on the other side - and then we can put it up in there right.</div>
<div><b>011:56:51 McCandless:</b> Okay. By the other side, do you mean over in the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>?</div>
<div><b>011:56:57 Mitchell:</b> That's affirmative.</div>
<div class="comment">Long comm break.</div>
<div><b>012:00:38 Roosa:</b> Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>012:00:41 McCandless:</b> Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>012:00:44 Roosa:</b> Okay, Bruce. We cycled it - oh, about four or five times, and it goes in just so easily. The capture latches dock and hold it, and we've tried it by putting the capture latch release handle at 150 and putting it up and they move in. We've tried it by leaving it - you know, the yellow - and cocking them by pushing in on the end of the probe on the probe release plunger. And it works both ways, just real fine. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>012:01:24 McCandless:</b> So, what you're trying to tell me is you still haven't come up with anything that would be the problem.</div>
<div><b>012:01:30 Roosa:</b> That's basically it.</div>
<div><b>012:01:38 McCandless:</b> Would you pass over to Al that, while you've got the probe and drogue in the tunnel there and mated - He's on the other side - and keeping them engaged, would he push the capture latch release button in and out several times and see if he can make it stick up against the bushing by pushing sideways, or anything of that sort, on it while it's being pushed in and out.</div>
<div><b>012:02:01 Roosa:</b> Okay. We'll try that.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>012:04:47 McCandless:</b> 14, this is Houston. While you're up there in the tunnel, we'd like to get a roll angle read-out on - from the index mark as you come back through; and, with respect to further procedures, I guess we got a - a write-in comment coming down here which is a step that says further instructions will follow tomorrow. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>012:05:20 Mitchell:</b> Didn't quite understand all that, Bruce. But try it, try us again.</div>
<div><b>012:05:24 McCandless:</b> Okay, we're asking for a docking tunnel roll index reading at your convenience, and ...</div>
<div><b>012:05:32 Mitchell:</b> Okay, we got that.</div>
<div><b>012:05:34 McCandless:</b> You've exhausted our imaginations for right now on troubleshooting the probe. We'll work on it some more overnight and be back with you in the morning.</div>
<div><b>012:05:47 Mitchell:</b> Roger, Houston. Understand.</div>
<div><b>012:05:53 McCandless:</b> And would you confirm that Al was unsuccessful in getting the capture latch release button to bind up against that bushing in the end of the probe?</div>
<div><b>012:06:06 Roosa:</b> That's a negative, Bruce. We cycled it several times; and he pushed on it and tried to jimmy it; and we - The thing slides in just so easily and locks up; and, when he pushes on the - on the plunger, why she releases very easily; and we can't seem to find any bind or get it to malfunction for us at all. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>012:06:34 McCandless:</b> Okay. While you're holding the - holding the probe in place there, we were wanting him to just take and cycle the capture latch release button in and out several time trying to - doing his best to bind it up against anything he can find there in the way of the internal surface of the bushing. I guess you're telling me that he was unable to.</div>
<div><b>012:06:56 Roosa:</b> Okay. Well, we hadn't really run that specific test. We'll try that.</div>
<div class="comment">Long comm break.</div>
<div><b>012:11:12 Mitchell:</b> Houston, we're bringing Al back through. We cannot force it to malfunction at all. So, you'll have to think about it overnight.</div>
<div><b>012:11:20 McCandless:</b> Roger, 14. We'll do that. We recommend that after you get Al back on the command module side, you reinstall the drogue in the command module hatch and keep the probe over in the command module, We believe we've seen enough TV data for the time being, so you can shut down the television at your convenience. And we would like to get photographic documentation of the capture latch release button, of each capture latch hook, and of any areas of scratches or visual damage on the probe, Ed.

<div class="pao">This Apollo Control at 12 hours, 20 minutes. We're in the process now of handing over shifts flight director Jerry Griffin and his team of flight controllers coming on now to replace flight director Milton Wendler. During the shift that is just ending, the Wendler team came on just after the Apollo 14 crew had successfully completed docking on the sixth attempt that occurred at ground elapsed time of 4 hours, 56 minutes, 46 seconds. And following that, the Saturn <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> was successfully configured for the auxiliary propulsion system evasive maneuver and the subsequent launch dump and midcourse correction to put the Saturn third stage on a trajectory which will impact the moon in the vicinity of the Apollo 12 seismometer. The up flight dynamics officer had a bit of difficulty in computing the exact impact coordinates due to a small undetermined small venting from some undetermined origin on the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a>. The venting apparently having no significant effect on the trajectory but affecting the data on which the trajectory is computed. And at this point our trajectory analysis is not too precise, we expect that with additional tracking that the impact coordinates will be more precisely established. At the present time, the tracking data shows that the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> will impact at 8 degrees 34 minutes south 23 degrees 17 minutes west at a ground elapsed time of 82 hours, 37 minutes. And following the midcourse correction on the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a>, the crew was advised that the - it would be desirable to remove the probe and drogue assembly with the television activated and to trouble shoot the assembly and see if any obvious problem could be found. After going through a series of 12 step-by-step items, the only conclusion that the crew was able to reach was that there was no obvious defect with the probe or drogue assembly. The drogue was reinstalled in the tunnel area. The probe has been left out and additional trouble shooting will be done tomorrow after the crew completes it's sleep period getting the engineering support people in mission control and Downey, California some additional time to determine what area to proceed in trouble shooting next. The booster systems engineer's just reporting status on the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> the Saturn third stage, he reports that all tank pressures appear to be down to zero and that the booster is in a stable configuration. No further activities planned with the Saturn third stage. At 12 hours, 24 minutes into the mission Apollo 14 is 59,996 nautical miles [111,113 km] from Earth traveling at a speed of 7,395 feet per second [2,254 m/s].</div>

<div class="pao">Another comment by Stu Roosa on the continuing mystery of why the docking probe malfunctioned in the earlier attempts right after translunar injection to dock with the Lunar Module. Attempts to duplicate this failure in flight as well as here on the ground has been fruitless so far. The training model of the probe and drogue are sitting on the floor in the aisle next to the spacecraft communicators console here in mission control. Meanwhile, the tests in flight have been postponed or suspended until after the rest and meal period for the crew of Apollo 14. The Spacecraft is now 63,937 nautical miles [118,411 km] out from Earth, and a velocity of 7,100 feet per second [2,164 m/s]. We'll continue to monitor air ground here in Mission Control as the crew prepares for the nights rest and getting the spacecraft set up on the slow rotation of passive thermal control, <a href="acron.html#ptc"><font color=#206020>PTC</font></a>.

And, when we did our docking, as - as I was thrusting plus-X and then Al hit the retract, he said the talkbacks came back barber pole for - a time period; you know, like a couple of seconds before - and then went gray again when we got the - the dock.

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control, 13 hours, 50 minutes ground elapsed time. And that last exchange of conversation between Command Module Pilot, Stu Roosa, and spacecraft communicator, Fred Haise, here in mission control. Stu thought that one item that perhaps he did not mention during the earlier discussions of the docking probe problem, turned out he had mentioned them. They had to do with the indications of some devices in the cabin called talkback. They're little striped devices that show through a little window and when they're still they have stripes, when they're spinning they turn grey because of the visual effect of black and white stripes moving at high speed. However, if he had already mentioned these indicators earlier in the evening, he reported also that at 13 hours, 7 minutes ground elapsed time they had changed the Lithium Hydroxide canister in the Command Module. These canisters serve to scrub the Carbon Dioxide from the cabin atmosphere. Earlier this morning, the flight director, Jerry Griffin was down fiddling with the probe and drogue mechanism sitting on the floor here in mission control scratching his head over it. And at this time, or perhaps later in the day, at various locations around the country where the probe and drogue had been designed and manufactured, other people will be scratching their head trying to sort out why the drogue did not latch on the first several attempts at docking of Apollo 14. Flight plan calls for the crew to go to sleep at about 16 hours ground elapsed time which is about 2 hours, 8 minutes from now. There is an outside chance that they may decide to move that up a bit. At the present time they're getting set up in passive thermal control, <a href="acron.html#ptc"><font color=#206020>PTC</font></a>. Status reports coming out of the spacecraft analysis room, they're rather brief. All systems perking along quite nominally. Shows the - at 11 hours, 7 minutes the leak rate in the Lunar Module and Command Module tunnel joint was about 5/10 or 5/100 of a pound per hour of oxygen or atmosphere. Guidance and control are all up to snuff, communications are normal, displays in control all nominal, down through all the rest of the spacecraft systems. There is a slight drop below what is nominal at this time in the flight for the Command Module, Command Service Module reaction control systems propellants. In the propellant remaining, in as much as quite a bit was used in the several docking attempts but still within the acceptable budget. Electrical system, battery B is still charging in the command module. All other batteries are topped off, about 107.47 amp hours remaining in batteries A, B, and C. Fuel cells, cryogenic storage tanks, all operating normal at this time. No problems according to the notations by the spacecraft analysis room who generates these reports about every 2 hours. Apollo 14 now weighing, according to the space digital display, 98 110 pounds. Altitude above the Earth out from the Earth, 66,183 nautical miles [122,571 km], velocity, 6,943 feet per second [2,116 m/s]. And at 13 hours, 55 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control with an open circuit, Apollo 14 air-to-ground communications.</div>

<div><b>014:11:15 Haise:</b> Okay, whenever you get a chance, after the 52 there, I guess you can stop the <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> and reinitialize; we're in good Omni; read you now.</div>
<div><b>014:11:26 Shepard:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>014:11:46 Haise:</b> And, 14; Houston. We're not really sure what caused the <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> to diverge. It looked like a pretty good start unless you either vented something or maybe something continued to vent from a while back.</div>
<div><b>014:12:05 Shepard:</b> That's the more likely - we had a continuing vent.</div>
<div><b>014:12:09 Haise:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>014:13:03 Shepard:</b> Houston, Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>014:13:06 Haise:</b> Go ahead. And we got your Noun 93.</div>
<div><b>014:13:10 Shepard:</b> Oh, gosh. Did you give them the torquing time of 14:12:50?</div>
<div><b>014:13:15 Haise:</b> Okay.<div class="comment">Very long comm break.</div>

<div><b>014:25:57 Roosa:</b> Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>014:26:01 Haise:</b> 14, we're having a little trouble with data dropout in your present position. We'd like Omni Charlie. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>014:26:24 Roosa:</b> Say again, Fred, will you? You busted up on that one.</div>
<div><b>014:26:27 Haise:</b> Okay, Stu. We're having data dropouts. We'd like Omni Charlie.</div>
<div><b>014:26:38 Roosa:</b> Okay, Fred. Try us again real slow. You're - you're just coming in syllables.</div>
<div><b>014:26:44 Haise:</b> Okay. We would like Omni Charlie, Omni Charlie.</div>
<div><b>014:26:52 Roosa:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>014:27:11 Roosa:</b> Okay, there's Omni (cough) Omni Charlie. How's that?</div>
<div><b>014:27:14 Haise:</b> Okay. How do you read me now?</div>
<div><b>014:27:17 Roosa:</b> Okay. You're loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>014:27:19 Haise:</b> Roger. We were having some data dropouts on High Bit Rate there, Stu, and we - before we get ready to crank up <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a>, we'll have you go back to Bravo then.</div>
<div><b>014:27:33 Roosa:</b> Okay.</div>

<div><b>014:33:58 Shepard:</b> Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>014:33:59 Haise:</b> We're showing O<sub>2</sub> flow pegged high down here. Just wondered if you're getting that on board, too.</div>
<div><b>014:34:10 Shepard:</b> Yes, we are, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>014:34:13 Haise:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>014:34:14 Shepard:</b> We thought we'd stopped all - stopped all of the venting, but we apparently are still venting somewhere we're not aware of.</div>
<div><b>014:34:19 Haise:</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="comment">Long comm break.</div>
<div><b>014:38:43 Haise:</b> 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>014:38:47 Shepard:</b> Go ahead, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>014:38:49 Haise:</b> Just a question. Did I understand you to say that you had checked, and you got all of your vents closed up now?</div>
<div><b>014:39:01 Shepard:</b> That's affirmative, Fredo. We're looking right now to see if we can find where this is going. Stand by to mark.</div>
<div class="comment">Long comm break.</div>
<div><b>014:44:13 Haise:</b> 14, Houston. Did you change anything now? We're seeing the O<sub>2</sub> flow dropping off a bit.</div>
<div><b>014:44:24 Mitchell:</b> Did you see any marked change? We just [Garbled] ...</div>
<div><b>014:44:33 Haise:</b> Well, it was up over 0.9 there, Ed, and it's down around 0.7. Gone back up now, though; 0.8 something now. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>014:45:22 Haise:</b> 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>014:45:26 Mitchell:</b> Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>014:45:29 Haise:</b> Okay. Our - original thoughts were that it might be a 'ducer. If you haven't already done so, you might run through <a href="acron.html#ecs">ECS</a> MAL 1a and see how you come out of that one. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>014:45:55 Mitchell:</b> Well, Fredo, we can see the venting right now. We think we've got an actual problem.</div>
<div><b>014:46:01 Haise:</b> Okay. What side of the spacecraft, 14?</div>
<div><b>014:46:09 Mitchell:</b> Now it's coming out the port side.</div>
<div><b>014:46:14 Haise:</b> Okay, the port side.</div>
<div class="comment">Long comm break.</div>
<div><b>014:51:53 Haise:</b> 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>014:51:58 Mitchell:</b> Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>014:51:59 Haise:</b> Okay. We saw it drop off. I guess you cycled the Regs, Ed. So that would indicate the 'ducer's okay. You might check again the valve on top of the urine receptacle and make sure that guy is closed off.</div>
<div><b>014:52:17 Mitchell:</b> Yes, we're rechecking those now. [Garbled.]</div>
<div><b>014:52:21 Roosa:</b> Yes, Fred, I did that. And, in fact, I even closed the - the waste management dump just to see if Myrtle was leaking, but it didn't do any good.</div>
<div><b>014:52:31 Haise:</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="comment">Long comm break.</div>
<div><b>014:55:59 Haise:</b> 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>014:56:03 Mitchell:</b> Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>014:56:05 Haise:</b> Okay. You seeing any more venting overboard at this time?</div>
<div><b>014:56:12 Roosa:</b> That's affirmative, Fred. I was just sitting here watching it - just - it - it comes in spurts. Just about 30 seconds ago, we got a nice splash, and there's some right now. It looks like it's coming, you know, from over in the area of the - of the normal dumps.</div>
<div><b>014:56:32 Haise:</b> Roger.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>014:58:56 Haise:</b> 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>014:59:00 Roosa:</b> Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>014:59:02 Haise:</b> Gee, that oxygen flow looked like it had settled down there around 0.4, and then all at once it started - it jumped up again there just a half a minute ago or so. And, it looks like it's back down again. Did you all move anything else in that area?</div>
<div><b>014:59:21 Roosa:</b> Yes, Fred. We went back, cleaning up after that malfunction, and we had the Water Glycol valves Off and the emergency Regs, and Suit Demand; we didn't see any effect when we went through it. And then we just went and opened them up again, hear?</div>
<div><b>014:59:42 Haise:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>014:59:45 Mitchell:</b> It's settled down on our meter at 0.6 pounds an hour now, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>014:59:52 Haise:</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>015:01:51 Haise:</b> 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>015:01:55 Mitchell:</b> Go ahead, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>015:01:56 Haise:</b> Say, I guess we're happy with that O<sub>2</sub> flow you got now. It looks pretty stable, and the vehicle rates look okay to crank up a <a href="acron.html#ptc">PTC</a> again. We think we've got a handle on what happened except in - what really caused the first O<sub>2</sub> Flow High. Must be something you readjusted. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>015:02:26 Mitchell:</b> I don't know that we can have a good answer for you. Stu and I were just talking about we think quite possibly the - urine dump is leaking. We got it cycled now and shut clear off. Let's see if that helps any.</div>
<div><b>015:02:42 Haise:</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="comment">Long comm break.</div>
<div><b>015:08:39 Haise:</b> And, 14; Houston. We'd like Omni Bravo.</div>
<div><b>015:08:44 Mitchell:</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>015:11:23 Shepard:</b> Houston, this is Al. We're going to presleep checklist now. We thought we'd drop off a little bit early tonight.</div>
<div><b>015:11:32 Haise:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>015:12:02 Mitchell:</b> Houston, we're bringing direct O<sub>2</sub> valve on to pump the cabin up to 5.7 now.</div>
<div><b>015:12:08 Haise:</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="comment">Long comm break.</div>

<div><b>015:16:10 Haise:</b> We're configured down here to take the E-memory dump any time. Stand by 1. I'm going to check the - how the Omnis are. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>015:16:30 Roosa:</b> Okay, Fred. We ought to have you now. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>015:16:38 Roosa:</b> Houston, 14. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>015:16:40 Haise:</b> Okay. Loud and clear, Stu. Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>015:16:44 Roosa:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>015:16:46 Haise:</b> Okay. We're ready now, Stu, for the E-memory. They're all set.</div>
<div><b>015:16:54 Roosa:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control. The crew of Apollo 14 at the present time is going through their presleep check list, a little earlier than scheduled in the flight plan. Spacecraft now being tracked now through the Madrid tracking station of the deep space network. The crew had earlier called and said they wanted to go to sleep a little earlier and prior to that they were a flurry of questions back and forth about spurious high flow rate of oxygen in the Command Module, higher than normal that is, not excessively high, caused by some valve being open perhaps in the waste management system. Apparently it seems to have settled down. And the spacecraft seems to be in a good solid steady roll rate for passive thermal control. They passed up their onboard readouts of consumables. Battery amp power is remaining percentages of <a href="acron.html#rcs"><font color=#206020>RCS</font></a> propellants. Right now Apollo 14 as shown on the space digital display, as being 71,887 nautical miles [133,135 km] out from Earth, velocity now 6,570 feet per second [2,003 m/s]. We'll leave the air ground circuit up for a while longer until it appears that the crew has settled down for the sleep period. At 15 hours, 24 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.</div>

<div class="pao"> This is Apollo Control at 15 hours, 47 minutes ground elapsed time and apparently the crew of Apollo 14 has retired for the night. That last conversation between Stu Roosa and spacecraft communicator Fred Haise here in Mission Control. The flight surgeon on the Gold team Dr. Willard Hawkins said he couldn't really tell yet from his biomedical data at his console who was asleep yet. He said it appears that spacecraft Commander Shepard's now nearing sleep status but he couldn't really tell. We'll take down the air to ground circuits and if there are any further conversations after the sleep period which has now begun, we'll play those back on a delayed basis from tapes. Present position of the spacecraft 73,420 nautical miles [135,974 km] out, velocity 6,476 feet per second [1,974 m/s] and at 15 hours, 48 minutes ground elapsed time, this Apollo Control.</div>

<div><b>016:02:14 Roosa:</b> Houston, did you call 14?</div>
<div><b>016:02:17 Haise:</b> Yes. Right, Stu. One last thing. Looks like maybe an O<sub>2</sub> tank number 1 heater is on. Tank 2 switches should be number 1 and 2, Off; number 3 on Auto. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>016:02:37 Roosa:</b> Okay. 3 is Auto, and 1 and 2 O<sub>2</sub> tanks are Off.</div>
