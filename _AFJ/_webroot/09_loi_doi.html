<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control Houston at
69 hours 47 minutes now in the flight of Apollo 14. We
presently show the Apollo 14 spacecraft at a distance of
27 999 nautical miles [51,854 km] away from the moon. And travelling
at a speed of 3353 feet per second [1,022 m/s]. We've had no contact
with the crew now well into their rest period since
our last report. However, in Mission Control, Flight
Director, Pete Frank, has been holding discussions with
Mr. Sig Sjoberg, Director of Flight Operations and Mission
Director, Chet Lee and other , about the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> battery test
being considered. This - a test on <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> battery number five
which had shown a low readout during the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> house-keeping
activities early this morning. Battery number five voltage
reading, both on the ground and through - crew
readout read 36.7 volts, the normal reading is 37 volts.
The proposed test would aid in determining if this in fact
is a fault of the battery or an instrumentation or sensor
problem. It has not yet been decided when the test may be
held either at <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> activation or before. We're at 69 hours
49 minutes <a href="acron.html#get"><font color=#206020>GET</font></a>, and we will shortly be undergoing a shift
hand over in Mission Control, and a change of shift news
conference will be held between the hours of 12:30 and
one o'clock. This is Apollo Control Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 70 hours 22 minutes.
The crew still has a little over 4 and a half hours remaining in
this rest period. At the present time we are in the process of
completing the shift hand over. Flight director Milton Windler
getting briefed by the off going flight director Pete Frank.
Windler will shortly be going around the room and checking on
the mission status with each of his flight controllers reviewing
the status of the mission. At this point, a change of shift
news briefing is scheduled to occur in the main auditorium of
building 1. As soon as the shift hand over is completed, our
best estimate on that at the present time would be about 15
minutes. At 1:30 a Sky Lab Briefing is scheduled. That briefing
if the news conference runs long will follow immediately
after the change of shift news conference. And it will also
be held in the main auditorium of building 1. At the present
time we show Apollo 14 traveling at a velocity of 3366 feet
per second [1,026 m/s] and 26 819 nautical miles [49,669 km] from the moon. At 70
hours 23 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 73 hours 12
minutes. We're still considering the possibility of having
the crew reenter the lunar module, following their sleep
period to run a test on the ascent battery, which is showing,
at last check a slightly below normal open circuit voltage.
No decision has been made at this time as to whether or not
that will be done ahead of the flight plan. If it is decided
to run the check, it would most likely be performed following
the midcourse correction 4 and before the lunar orbit insertion.
The midcourse correction 4 is currently scheduled at 77 hours
38 minutes. The maneuver will be performed at this time, anyway,
with the <a href="acron.html#sps"><font color=#206020>SPS</font></a>, the Service Propulsion System engine. The
current velocity change required appears to be about 3.6 feet
per second [1.1 m/s]. That could be performed with the service propulsion
system using a minimum impulse burn of about .6 of a second.
The crew has a little bit more then 1 hour 45 minutes remaining
in their rest period. We plan to let them sleep the
full time if they so desire. Flight Director Milton Windler
checked with the Flight Activities Officer a short while ago
to see if it would be possible to extend the sleep period
if the crew is still sleeping at the end of the period, and
the Flight Activities Officer replied that it would be
possible to extend it by as much as about 30 minutes and
still not run into any problems getting the midcourse correction
performed on time. We have a video tape of last
nights television of the lunar module housekeeping, which
we prepared to replay at this time. The video replay will
be in black and white, in order to minimize wear on the tapeheads
of the color converter, and we'll play that video tape
back at this time."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 74 hours 12 minutes.
We now have about 47 minutes remaining in the crew
rest period. Around the Flight Directors console, for the
past 45 minutes or so, there have been a series of group
discussions on the procedures that are being worked out for
checking out the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> ascent battery. Flight Director Milton
Windler advised the Flight Controllers of the progress of
the discussions a short while ago. He said at this time,
we still do not have a decision as to whether or not we'll
attempt to get into the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> and check out the battery, although
he said, we do appear to be moving in that direction. If the
crew is advised to enter the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> and run the test on the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a>
battery, it would be done after midcourse correction 4 which
is scheduled to occur at about 77 hours 38 minutes. We would
like to have the crew completed with activities in the lunar
module and back in the command module by about 80 hours to
allow adequate time for the lunar orbit insertion maneuver,
which is scheduled to occur at about 82 hours 38 minutes.
At the present time we show Apollo 14 traveling at a velocity
of 3487 feet per second [1,063 m/s]. Now 19068 nautical miles [35,314 km] from the
moon. At 74 hours 14 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston"<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 74 hours,
52 minutes. The Apollo 14 crew is scheduled to end its
rest period in about 10 - about 8 minutes from this time.
We are prepared to let the crew sleep an additional 30 minutes
if they so desire. When the crew is awake we plan to discuss
with them procedures for checking out battery 5 in the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a>
ascent stage and if the crew concurs we will have them
re-enter the Lunar Module at about 78 hours to run the test
on battery 5. Essentially the way the test is planned is
to have the battery 5, which is hooked to the Lunar Module
pilots bus in the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a>, remove from that bus and attach to
the commanders bus where the open circuit voltage can be
measured with another sensor. If the sensor on that bus
again measures the slight decrease in voltage that was shown
on the Lunar Module Pilot bus, that is about 36.7 volts as
opposed to 37 volts, the battery will be - the reading will
be verified by putting the battery 6 back on the Commanders
bus and comparing the reading on that battery and if in
fact a difference does exist between the two batteries and
battery 5 continues to show a lower reading, it will be
tested under LOAD and by putting some equipment on line and
we'll be watching to see if the batteries share the load
equally and if battery 5 is able to maintain full output or
able to hold up to 2 amps of load - under load. This procedure
will be discussed with the crew and others and if the crew
concurs, the <a href="acron.html#ivt"><font color=#206020>IVT</font></a> into the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a>, the intravehicular transfer
to the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> will occur at about 78 hours. At the present
time we show Apollo 14 17,671 nautical miles [32,727 km] from the moon.
The spacecraft velocity is 3,518 feet per second [1,072 m/s]. We'll
continue to stand by live from this point on for word from
the crew that they are up or in the event that we don't
hear from them in 5 minutes or so when they are scheduled
to awake in about 30 minutes when the Capcom would put in
a call. At 74 hours, 56 minutes - 55 minutes, this is
Apollo Control Houston, standing by."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 75 hours,
30 minutes. We're nearing the end now of the 30 minute
extension to the crew's sleep period and we expect that
Capcom, Bruce McCandless will be putting in a call shortly
to the crew. At the present time Apollo 14 is 16,433 nautical
miles [30,434 km] from the moon. The spacecraft velocity has increased
now to 3,549 feet per second [1,082 m/s]."<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "Our communications engineer reports
that we're getting carrier downlink from the spacecraft
indicating that the crew is up and about and preparing to
give us a call. So we'll continue to stand by for that."<p>

<b>075:49:19 Mitchell:</b> Our - We're starting. The cooks are in the kitchen at the moment. Our
radiation readings for last night - or rather for this morning are 16045 for

<b>075:49:46 McCandless:</b> Roger. 16045 for Al, 01042 for Stu, 05038 for Ed, and how about
quantity of sleep? Do you have any comments on that? Over.<p>

<b>075:50:00 Mitchell:</b> Roger. For Al, 6 hours; Stu, 6-1/2; and for Ed, 6-1/2. [Long pause]<p>

<b>075:50:14 McCandless:</b> Roger, Ed. And Ed, when you - when you all feel prepared, we've got
quite an extensive batch of paperwork to pass up to you here.<p>

<b>075:50:29 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Bruce. Stand by 1.<p>

<b>075:50:32 McCandless:</b> Roger.<p>

<b>075:50:36 Mitchell:</b> Is it all going to be associated with the flight plan?<p>

<b>075:50:39 McCandless:</b> Well, let's see. We got - we got a comment on the T<sub>ephem</sub>. We've got
a flight-plan update. We've got a docking probe status report. We've got a pericynthion plus 2
abort pad. We will have an <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> abort chart in numbers - criterion update. We'll have some
questions for you on the cosmic ray flashes. And when it comes in, we'll have a procedure for you
for checking out the ascent stage battery number 5 in the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>075:51:14 McCandless:</b> Also the sports news and commentary on midcourse 4.<p>

<b>075:51:21 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Why don't we get the flight plan first, so that we can kind of
see where we're going. And then we'll string the others out throughout and after breakfast.<p>

<b>075:51:32 McCandless:</b> Okay. Actually, I think you were looking over my shoulder, because
the flight-plan update is about the simplest of the whole bunch. What we're aiming towards here ...<p>

<b>075:51:44 Mitchell:</b> We are looking over your shoulder.<p>

<b>075:51:48 McCandless:</b> (Laughter) What we're aiming towards here is getting you into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>
shortly after midcourse correction 4 - to do a little more systems detective work on ascent
battery 5. Make everybody feel a little warmer down here. And, of course, the rest of the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> is
still in 4 0 shape. At 76 hours in the flight plan, we'd like you to
pressurize the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> as required. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>075:52:34 Mitchell:</b> Okay. 76 hours, pressurize the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> as required.<p>

<b>075:52:38 McCandless:</b> Roger. At 77 hours, plus 45 minutes, which is right after midcourse
4, maneuver to Moon-view attitude. And that attitude is presently contained in the flight plan at
78 plus 55 and is roll 352, 110, 311. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>075:53:16 Mitchell:</b> Roger. Maneuver to Moon-view attitude, and say again the angles. I
understand that's at 77:45, right after midcourse 4.<p>

<b>075:53:24 McCandless:</b> Roger. Angles are 352, 110, 311, and they're
currently in the flight plan at 78 plus 55. [Long pause]<p>

<b>075:54:14 McCandless:</b> You still there, Ed?<p>

<b>075:54:22 Mitchell:</b> That's affirmative. Okay, I have moved it from 78:55 to 77:45.<p>

<b>075:54:28 McCandless:</b> Roger. And this is a good attitude for <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> communication on Aft Omni.
And the procedure that we'll have for you later on will have the S-band up for telemetry but not
for voice, so you want to use Aft Omni? At 78 hours, or from 78 hours to 80 hours even, we have
blocked out for <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> checkout of the ascent batteries so you can plan on <a href="acron.html#ivt">IVT</a> to the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> at about 78
hours and be back out by 80. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>075:55:05 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Understand that the attitude we're going to is good for the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>
Aft Omni, and we will <a href="acron.html#ivt">IVT</a> to the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> at 78 hours for a battery-5 checkout and
be back - plan to be hack by 80 hours.<p>

<b>075:55:19 McCandless:</b> Roger. And meanwhile, back in the command module, Stu can press on
with the rest of the normal command module activities, such as the <a href="acron.html#p52">P52</a> and all that.<p>

<b>075:55:30 Mitchell:</b> Okay. You're going to have some good words on the ascent battery 5 for
me, you say, in a little while.<p>

<b>075:55:37 McCandless:</b> Yes, indeed. Joe Engle was just over in the <a href="acron.html#lms">LMS</a> here in Houston
running through the thing, and it's a fairly - fairly long procedure as far as handwriting goes,
but relatively straightforward, and we'll cover it for you in detail.<p>

<b>075:55:56 Mitchell:</b> Okay.<p>

<font color=#006000>
<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "Joe Engle is the Lunar Module Pilot
on the backup crew."<p>

</font>
<b>075:56:02 McCandless:</b> Would you like a general breakdown on what we plan to do?<p>

<b>075:56:09 Mitchell:</b> I'll stand by until you're ready to read it out,
but maybe you can give me a summary before.<p>

<b>075:56:13 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]<p>

<b>075:56:25 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Ready for the next item.<p>

<b>075:56:27 McCandless:</b> Okay. This is the docking probe status summary. The conclusion down
here is that, on your final successful attempt, the probe's spring started to compress slightly,
followed by capture latch engagement. And the dock latch went barber pole, and then the bottle
fired and retraction was normal, although the time was somewhat shorter due to the continued
firing of the service module <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a>. The talkback operation during initial extension and final
docking plus the accelerometer data, the capture latch release mode occurrence during the
extensions, all indicated normal extension, capture, and retract sequence. Some consideration was
given to the possibility that the <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> thrusting compressed the probe until the docking latches
engaged, but this would have required more force than the <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> provides. As we mentioned yesterday,
we are still Go for the mission. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>075:57:34 Mitchell:</b> Okay. And I think I'd like to have you repeat that after Al and Stu get
on the headsets so that I won't have to write the whole thing down. I think they'd like to hear it.<p>

<b>075:57:43 McCandless:</b> Okay. How about a pericynthion ... [Long pause]<p>

<b>075:58:24 Mitchell:</b> Go ahead, Bruce.<p>

<b>075:58:26 McCandless:</b> Okay, Ed. We're getting a lot of noise on the downlink right now.
Let's stand by until after we shift antennas again.

<font color=#006000>
<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "Astronauts Dick Gordon, Pete Conrad,

</font>
<b>076:00:09 McCandless:</b> Okay, 14. How do you read now?<p>

<b>076:00:15 Mitchell:</b> Loud and clear, now, Bruce. Okay, our status at the moment - we're
going to hold the probe report until Al and Stu get on the headsets. Let's
press on. What's the next thing you have?<p>

<b>076:00:26 McCandless:</b> Okay. Pericynthion plus 2 abort pad, standing by; P30. [Long pause]<p>

<font color=#006000>
<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "The pericynthion plus 2 abort pad,

ground on me down here. They seem to be piling up faster than we can get them read up.<p>

<b>076:04:18 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Bruce, on the angles on that one. The roll was N/A, pitch was 84,
and yaw was zero. Is that correct?<p>

<b>076:04:25 McCandless:</b> Yaw was N/A. Actually, if you want the numbers, roll would be 356 and
yaw would be 009. We understood there was a previous agreement that you were just going to use
pitch for checking, and you would take the roll and yaw as computed by P40. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:04:51 Mitchell:</b> Okay. All right, press on.<p>

<b>076:05:00 McCandless:</b> Okay. Let me hold off on this midcourse-4 pad a minute. I can give
you just a second's worth of discussion on the thing. It's coming out to 3.8 feet per second, and
this is very close to your <a href="acron.html#sps">SPS</a> minimum impulse. It'll be 0.69 seconds of burn time compared to
your guaranteed 0.50 min impulse, and when you get down to <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a><sub>c</sub> the value of 2/10ths is what

<b>076:10:41 Mitchell:</b> Houston, 14. How do you read now?<p>

<b>076:10:48 McCandless:</b> Okay. When you have a chance we'd like <a href="acron.html#p00">P00</a> and Accept Ed. And we'll

<b>076:11:23 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Bruce. You have <a href="acron.html#p00">P00</a> and Accept.<p>

<b>076:11:29 McCandless:</b> Okay, Ed. You may recall our discussion on T<sub>ephem</sub> last evening,
with regard to the sign of the quantity in R<sub>3</sub>. We've had a request down here that you, on the

<b>076:12:01 Mitchell:</b> Let me double check. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:12:27 Mitchell:</b> Roger. Those are the numbers 00006, 39223, and

<b>076:12:35 McCandless:</b> Roger, that's the one.<p>

<b>076:12:39 Mitchell:</b> Okay, we'll load these in after while.<p>

<b>076:12:42 McCandless:</b> Let us finish with the uplink first. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:12:57 McCandless:</b> Okay, Ed. We have a - a rather detailed change to the <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> Mode I <a href="acron.html#dps">DPS</a>
abort chart and numerical data. This is found in the flight plan in the Contingency Checklist, and
the numerical stuff is on one of your cue cards. It'd probably be easiest if you broke out the
flight plan, say, and went through it with me. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:13:30 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Did you get my readback on the midcourse-4 pad?<p>

<b>076:13:42 McCandless:</b> Uh ...<p>

<b>076:13:49 Mitchell:</b> It sounded to me like you dropped out before I finished reading it back. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:14:04 McCandless:</b> Yes. As far as - as far as I can tell, I got all of it. I recall
definitely down through Sirius and Rigel, and I believe I recall your reading the High-Gain

<b>076:14:20 Mitchell:</b> Okay, thank you. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:15:00 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Bruce. Give me a few words on the <a href="acron.html#dps">DPS</a> abort changes before we
start giving the actual numbers.<p>

<b>076:15:11 McCandless:</b> Okay, you have a change in the <a href="acron.html#dps">DPS</a> <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> available line due to a
different engine model, change in the spacecraft weight, and a change in the usable propellant
from the time that this curve was calculated. You have a change in the two other lines, which are
the <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> plus 2-hour and <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> plus 30-minute abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> based on the change in your orbit from
the nominal plan. This all backs up to the 40-minute-late lift-off. And the numerical changes are
a consequence of that, also. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:15:56 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Let's start through them slowly then and see
if we can correct them.<p>

<b>076:16:02 McCandless:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>076:16:08 McCandless:</b> Over here in the <a href="acron.html#dps">DPS</a> <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> available line, the left-hand intercept
is at abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of 1966 feet per second at <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of zero. The right-hand intercept on
the vertical dashed line comes at an abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of 2130 and the <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of 725. Then
connect the two intercepts together with a straight line. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:16:51 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Stand by. The first one is 1966. Let's just
take them one at a time, and I'll plot them.<p>

<b>076:16:57 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:17:08 Mitchell:</b> And you say the - the right-hand intercept is 21 what ?<p>

<b>076:17:14 McCandless:</b> Is 2130, 2130, and it falls on that vertical dashed line at 725. It
separates Mode I from Mode II.<p>

<b>076:17:27 Mitchell:</b> I got it.<p>

<b>076:17:29 McCandless:</b> Okay, connect them up.<p>

<b>076:17:37 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston. The computer's yours. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:17:49 Mitchell:</b> Okay, I'm in Block. Give me the next line now.<p>

<b>076:17:54 McCandless:</b> Roger. In the <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> plus 2-hour abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> region, the left-hand
intercept is at 1477 feet per second. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:18:13 Mitchell:</b> Copy, 1477.<p>

<b>076:18:16 McCandless:</b> Roger. And the right-hand end point is at 2026 abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a>, and <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a>
<a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of 238. It should intercept your <a href="acron.html#dps">DPS</a> <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> available line where it crosses the boundary
between the Mode I 2 hour and the Mode I 30 minutes. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:18:41 Mitchell:</b> Roger. Took care of that, and let me draw that one.<p>

<b>076:18:51 McCandless:</b> Okay. You ready for the next one?<p>

<b>076:19:02 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Ready for the next one.<p>

<b>076:19:04 McCandless:</b> Okay. Over in the <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> plus 30-minute abort region, the left-hand
intercept, with the boundary between Mode I 2 hour and Mode I 30 minutes, occurs at abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a>
of 1517 and <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of 238. Over.<p>

<b>076:19:23 McCandless:</b> And we're going down in the mud again, Ed. I'm going to wait for the

<b>076:19:34 Mitchell:</b> Okay. I've got you at 1517 for the first one.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>076:22:04 McCandless:</b> Okay, 14, Houston. We're coming back in now. I confirm 1517 for the
left-hand edge, and the righthand intercept is at abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of 2395 on the
725 <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> magnitude dashed line. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:23:29 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Bruce. Have that line plotted.<p>

<b>076:23:32 McCandless:</b> Okay. And all three of those lines ought to be pretty close to
parallel to the existing lines; you concur?<p>

<b>076:23:40 Mitchell:</b> Yes, they sure are.<p>

<b>076:23:44 McCandless:</b> Okay. Over to the numerical data. Come on over to the - the little
block there and, on the second line down under burn time starting out with 0 plus 33, Mode I,
loose, it should be zero plus 33 through 1 plus 19, and <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a><sub>M</sub> is 238 through 570. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:24:27 Mitchell:</b> Okay. The burn - the burn - burn time from 033 to 115 should be 033 to
119, and the corresponding <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a><sub>M</sub> is 238 to 570.<p>

<b>076:24:43 McCandless:</b> Roger. Next line down. The burn time is 1 plus 19 through 1 plus 40,
and the burn time is - or the <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> M is 570 through 725. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>076:25:05 Mitchell:</b> Okay. We change from 119 to 140 and <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a><sub>M</sub> is 570 to 725.<p>

<b>076:25:14 McCandless:</b> Roger. On the next line down, you change 1 plus 39 to 1 plus 40, so
it reads 1 plus 40 through 2 plus 41. Over.<p>

<b>076:25:26 Mitchell:</b> Okay. One - The next line is 140 to 241.<p>

<b>076:25:30 McCandless:</b> Okay, now down below it, you've got a column for updated times. And

<b>076:27:49 McCandless:</b> Okay, Ed. The readback is correct except that you omitted the roll,

changed from 263 to 264. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control at 76 hours 37
minutes. We are beginning a shift hand over at this time.
Flight Director Jerry Griffin coming on to replace Flight
Director Milton Windler and the capsule communicator on
the upcoming shift will be astronaut Fred Haise. We do
anticipate a change of shift briefing, probably within about
30 minutes of the shift handover which is scheduled to
occur at 7:30. Also during the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> impact, which will be
occurring early tomorrow morning at about 1:26 AM central
standard time, we will have Dr. David W. Strangway, who is
chief of the Geophysics branch at the Manned Spacecraft
Center available in the news center briefing room to
provide background on the event and also to do what
real time data analysis is possible. We will have video
from the control center piped into the briefing room and
we'll have available such things as video of the seismic data
that we are expecting to receive on the Apollo 12 passive
seismometer. At the present time we are showing that the
impact will occur at a ground elapsed time of 83 hours 17
minutes, 55 seconds, and the current impact coordinates for
the <a href="acron.html#sivb"><font color=#206020>S-IVB</font></a> are 7 degrees, 52 minutes

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - "This is Apollo Control 77 hours 27 minutes
ground elapsed time. Flight Director Gerry Griffin who
heads up the gold team of flight controllers is settling
in to his chair in the middle of the room and having handover
from Flight Director Milton Windler off going shift.
Meanwhile aboard Apollo 14 the crew's making preparations
for the midcourse correction burn number 4 upcoming in
9 minutes and 45 seconds. That burn with an ignition time
of 77 hours 38 minutes 14 seconds will be for a 3.8 feet
per second [1.2 m/s] change in velocity. Total burn time is .7
of a second which for that big engine is a wee small burp.
The midcourse correction burn number 4 in local time will
be 8:01:14 central time. Communications engineers asked
that the crew be asked to swivel the high gain antenna for
a better lockon upcoming on this burn - apparently the
communications is somewhat spotty at this time. We're
standing by live on air-ground with Apollo 14 for the upcoming
burn."<p>

Did you mean you tried four times on the Secondary Servo Electronics to get locked up?<p>

enough delay time before I tried something else when it was in the Narrow position. But I thought
I was, and I don't know what I did differently on the last attempt that did work than the previous
attempts which didn't work.<p>

<b>078:06:30 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Fredo. I'm through the tunnel and ingressing the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> at this

<b>078:06:40 Haise:</b> Okay, I'll let Joe talk to you here and kind of give you a few words on
the big picture. And then we'll start in.<p>

<b>078:06:50 Mitchell:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>078:06:52 Engle:</b> Okay, Ed. What this is going to amount to is an abbreviated - a very
abbreviated powerup, and we will transfer to <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> power; so, Stu, you can stand by, and we'll get
our own times on that. Now, Ed, if we have a comm problem any time during this - and we are out of
configuration - just get the activation checklist and go to page 1-17 and
complete the deactivation from that point on. [Long pause]<p>

<b>078:07:41 Engle:</b> And, Ed, if you're ready to go now, we'll start through here.<p>

<b>078:07:50 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Joe. How about giving me a quick overall picture of the problem
as you saw it from the ground. I didn't see much of anything here that was indicative of a problem.<p>

<b>078:07:59 Engle:</b> Okay. Just a second here. [Long pause]<p>

<b>078:08:14 Engle:</b> Okay, Ed. I wanted to get the values correct here. <a href="acron.html#tm">TM</a> picked up about
3/lOths of a voltage - of a volt low on battery 5, which gave some concern, and, primarily, we
just want to verify that perhaps we're not - we don't have a gauge that's giving us that much of a
difference, rather than the battery itself. [Long pause]

<blockquote>
[Mission Control really does run a tight ship.  Although being 0.3 volts short of 37 volts
means only a very small loss in capacity for a battery that is more than big enough to do the
job and that has more than enough backup in case it should fail prematurely.
However, 37 volts was the expected value and 36.7 volts was out of tolerance.
They treated all problems in vital systems as potential safety problems until they could
convince themselves that it was indeed only a minor problem and not an early indication of
a serious problem.]</blockquote>

</font>
<b>078:08:40 Mitchell:</b> 3/10ths of a volt?<p>

<b>078:08:42 Engle:</b> Yes. That's affirmative. That's open-circuit voltage, Ed.<p>

<b>078:08:47 Mitchell:</b> As I recall, we read - Roger. As I recall, we read them off a half a
volt different, 36 and a half to 37. Is that right?<p>

<b>078:08:57 Engle:</b> Roger, Ed. That was half a volt onboard, and the
telemetry showed the 3/10ths down here.<p>

<b>078:09:07 Mitchell:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>078:09:08 Engle:</b> Okay. And essentially, Ed, what we're going to do is put the - put both
batteries on an open bus to read out both bus and battery voltages. And, if we're not satisfied
with the readings at that point, we'll go ahead and load up the <a href="acron.html#lmp">LMP</a> bus and - put a load on it
rather - and then check the battery performance both by itself and sharing a load on the <a href="acron.html#lmp">LMP</a> bus.<p>

<b>078:23:10 Engle:</b> Okay. And the Ascent <a href="acron.html#eca">ECA</a> breaker, also.<p>

<b>078:23:16 Mitchell:</b> That's negative.<p>

<b>078:23:21 Engle:</b> Okay. We'd like Ascent <a href="acron.html#eca">ECA</a> closed on 16, Ed.<p>

<b>078:23:29 Mitchell:</b> Okay. You've got it.<p>

<b>078:23:36 Engle:</b> Okay, Ed. Now we'll take - we'd like you to take Battery 6 to Off
momentarily and then back to Normal power, and you can watch Battery 5 voltage
there on your monitor.<p>

<b>078:23:49 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Battery 6 coming Off.<p>

<b>078:24:00 Mitchell:</b> Now when I cycle Battery 6, the Battery 5 voltage comes up when Battery

necessary for the lunar orbit insertion burn, which is now
scheduled for ground elapsed time of 82 hours 36 minutes 46

per second [920 m/s]. The lunar module pilot, Ed Mitchell went into
the lunar module earlier in the evening and checked out the
electrical system and in watching the telemet - telemeter displays
here in Mission Control, Apollo program Director Rocco
Petrone made the following comment: "We are happy with what
we saw. We haven't found anything to preclude descent. Other
ground tests are under way to further verify battery performance.
During the test, battery 5 shared the loads applied very well
without draining power from battery 6. The battery recovered
readily after the load was removed. At one time the load was
pushed to 30 amps during the test. The entire <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#206020>LM</font></a> battery system
will be thoroughly checked out during the power up of the
lunar module on descent day. We did however, determine that
the .3 of a volt low reading recorded earlier in the mission
was not an instrumentation fault." Presently Apollo 14 is
6863 nautical miles [12,710 km] out from the moon increasing in velocity

<b>080:47:04 Shepard:</b> Houston, Apollo 14. We're ready for the discussion of the probe, now.<p>

<b>080:47:10 Haise:</b> Okay, Al. Okay, the conclusion down here is that on your final attempt,
the probe spring started to compress slightly, followed by the capture latch engagement talkbacks
going barber pole. The bottle then fired and the retraction looked normal, although the time was
somewhat shorter due to the contingent firing of the command module <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> jets. The talkback
operation during the initial extension in the final docking, plus the accelerometer data, and also
the look-see at the capture latch release motor currents during the extension, all indicated a
normal extension, capture, and retract sequence. Some consideration, Al, was given to the
possibility that the <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> thrusting compressed the drogue/probe maybe until the docking latches
engaged, but the final word was that this would require more force than the <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> could provide. And
I guess the most important fact is - as discussed yesterday, we're Go for the mission.<p>

<b>080:47:56 Shepard:</b> Okay. Do you suggest any special docking technique
for the final docking and rendezvous?

it didn't work on the other - on the other docking.<p>

<b>080:49:52 Haise:</b> Yes, I guess we don't have that answer for you, Stu.<p>

<b>080:50:00 Haise:</b> All, all we can say is ...<p>

<b>080:50:02 Roosa:</b> Are - are we saying that the ...<p>

<b>080:50:07 Haise:</b> Yes. We can't explain the preceding attempts, but all we're saying is that
the one that worked looked normal.<p>

<b>080:50:22 Roosa:</b> Okay, I guess I disagree with it looking normal, but the probe sure does
look good now. Are you saying there's no correlation between the retraction and the - I mean,
using the retract bottle and getting the docking? [Long pause]<p>

<b>080:50:57 Haise:</b> Stand by 1, Stu. [Long pause]<p>

<b>080:51:25 Haise:</b> Okay. I'm not sure if I'm answering the question you, you, asked, Stu, but
what the data showed is that the - the bottle had fired, and started to pull things in before you
all actually worked the switch and maybe you thought the reverse was true. [Long pause]<p>

<b>080:51:51 Roosa:</b> What? Let me see - say that again, Fred. I don't understand that one.<p>

<b>080:52:04 Haise:</b> Okay, I guess there's a distinction in, maybe your impressions, and what
the data said was that you did get captured, normally before the bottle was
fired. Did you all have a different impression? [Long pause]<p>

<b>080:52:24 Roosa:</b> Yes. Stand by 1.<p>

<b>080:52:34 Roosa:</b> Yes, Fred, our impression was that - see the talkbacks going barber pole,
which would indicate the capture by the latches - didn't happen until, oh, I think as Al said the
other time, several seconds after he hit the Retract switch. [Long pause]<p>

<b>082:48:18 Roosa (onboard):</b> Okay.<p>

<b>082:48:40 Roosa (onboard):</b> Oh, brother. [Garbled.]<p>

<b>082:48:54 Roosa (onboard):</b> Okay, there are the Loveletts. See, right straight over your

it on the time from 180, Al.<p>

<b>082:51:21 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay [Garbled.]<p>

minutes, or 14 minutes - 38.<p>

<b>082:51:35 Shepard (onboard):</b> Hey, wait a minute; we got the damn clock running at 14. How
about that? Can you give me a mark on 15? [Garbled] It's beautiful.<p>

the way. And, of course, in the type of orbit we are, the fact that we're climbing away from the

<b>083:24:57 Roosa:</b> [Garbled] - okay [Garbled] -<p>

<b>083:24:58 Mitchell:</b> Al's trying to get us to get on with it; we're
trying to gawk at the same time. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:25:35 Roosa:</b> Okay, we're just starting to pick up the edge of Nectaris now, coming
across with the - can't quite see up far enough to - oh, yes, there's ole Daguerre 66, just like -
just like a neon sign out there.<p>

<b>083:25:55 Haise:</b> Okay, Stu, and we're looking at the tracers on the Apollo 12 seismometer,
and it's essentially still looking undamped. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:26:12 Mitchell:</b> Still vibrating ...<p>

<b>083:26:13 Roosa:</b> [Garbled] Great.<p>

<b>083:26:14 Mitchell:</b> Hello, Fredo.<p>

<b>083:26:15 Haise:</b> Yes, that's right, Ed.<p>

<b>083:26:24 Roosa:</b> Is it essentially like neutral stability, Fred, or they coming down on it?<p>

<b>083:26:31 Haise:</b> It looks like, if anything, Stu, maybe they're still building a little bit.<p>

<b>083:26:42 Roosa:</b> Ah so. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:27:05 Mitchell:</b> There's Theophilus, Stu, there at the top of the window; can you see it?

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>083:29:52 Mitchell:</b> You know, Fred, I get the impression that, just from looking at the
real thing, these craters are a lot fresher than the photographs led me to believe. I'm very
surprised at how fresh many of them look.<p>

<b>083:30:07 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>083:31:22 Mitchell:</b> We've just been remarking up here, Fredo, how easy it is to find these
landmarks. They just stand right out for you. It's really magnificent.<p>

<b>083:31:31 Haise:</b> Let's hope Cone and Triplet and Doublet show up the same way.<p>

<b>083:31:41 Mitchell:</b> You're right.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>083:32:52 Roosa:</b> Hey, Fredo, my first impression as I - How do you read, Fred?<p>

<b>083:33:00 Haise:</b> I read you loud and clear, Stu. Go ahead.<p>

<b>083:33:05 Roosa:</b> Okay. First impression of the Theophilus and Cyrillus is - much difference
in age than what I expected. Of course, Theophilus being the younger, but it's much more so than
what I really expected - to see, and we hope to get some good photos of the line between the two
there; but it's pretty amazing how much more subdued Cyrillus is. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:33:45 Haise:</b> Okay, we copied that, Stu. And, we're up with you on the chart now, too.<p>

<b>083:33:54 Roosa:</b> Okay. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:34:07 Roosa:</b> Okay. And we're just approaching Descartes now, Fredo. I'm looking out of
my rendezvous window, and four of those too-bright craters on either side of the landing site.
Just - it's so plain. I guess I'm surprised at the detail - that you can see. Of course, the Sun
angle is dropping down a little here, but I thought probably at Descartes, the two bright lead-ins
- but - you can see many, many of the fine - the fine craters in between them. And, of course,
Dollond, Dollond E, and Kant, they're all just very vivid. But, the - the detail you can see from
this altitude of the Descartes sites are rather amazing. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:34:57 Haise:</b> Roger, Stu. I hope the <a href="acron.html#ltc">LTC</a> captures the same detail, a
little greater maybe.<p>

<b>083:35:08 Roosa:</b> Roger. And it'll he a little lower, too.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>083:37:31 Roosa:</b> Fredo, I - At this point, we're start to pick up a few shadows on the
edges of the craters, but the crater chain coming out of Abulfeda - really can't see much
difference in albedo between the crater itself and a good bit of the surrounding territory.<p>

<b>083:37:48 Haise:</b> Okay, Stu.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>083:39:52 Mitchell:</b> Okay. We're crossing over Albategnius and we can look up and see
Ptolemaeus; yes, it's coming in to the hatch window now. That's very stark. I'm very impressed by
the different - by albedo differences here, Fredo, that I - that I assume from photographs are
really more Sun angle problems or photographic problems. But, by golly, there's some that are
really here that I never expected. They must indicate contacts of some sort that may be very
subtle on the surface; but I actually believe they're there, if one can find them. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:40:39 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed. Do you mean - you talking in terms of large scale or small
scale, like within crater floor?<p>

<b>083:40:53 Mitchell:</b> No, I'm thinking of a little larger scale than that. But there are some
in the crater floors that are very surprising, too. There's so many things that I assumed from
maps were more photographic peculiarities rather than real life, but, by
golly, I think they're here.<p>

<b>083:41:11 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed.<p>

<b>083:41:20 Mitchell:</b> I think, given time, we could find flows and different units that may
very well be covered with a great deal of regolith that we - we're seeing suggestions of them in
albedo differences and textural differences that are clearly visible from this altitude.<p>

<b>083:41:41 Haise:</b> Okay. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:41:53 Roosa:</b> I've noticed some lineations in some of the - the big craters that are
suggestive of - well, I'm not sure it's of the sloping type of circular lineations that you see in
craters. I guess, to be safe, I ought to guess that - so I'll be safe and not say any more. I did
see lineations that were surprising to me. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:42:21 Haise:</b> These close to the wall, Ed, or down within the floor of the crater itself?<p>

<b>083:42:28 Mitchell:</b> Well, all up and down the wall of a few craters; I don't recall which
ones now - back along our track here a few miles. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:43:07 Mitchell:</b> Looking down at the Crater Herschel, for example, Fredo, on the - Let's
see, on the western wall. To me, it appears as though it's really a solid chunk from - the rim
down to the first slope, or the - where it breaks slope. Of course, this is a long ways away to be
talk - making talk like that. However, it seems - it gives one the impression
of being very hard solid rock [Garbled.] [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:43:39 Haise:</b> Okay, we copied, Ed. Herschel's west wall looks like essentially one unit.<p>

<b>083:43:50 Mitchell:</b> That's affirmative.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>083:45:05 Haise:</b> And, 14; Houston. The 12 seismometers are still going. The traces right
now look maybe to be almost neutral.<p>

<b>083:45:20 Roosa:</b> Okay. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:45:52 Roosa:</b> Okay, Fredo. We just passed over Mosting A, which we'll get a better look
at next time around, and the baby crater chain stands out real vividly and just starting to get a
pretty low Sun angle here, so any albedo differences about those will be hard to tell now. You can
see the dark halo spots along the rilles in Alphonsus, however, very vividly. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:46:23 Haise:</b> Roger, Stu. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:46:44 Mitchell:</b> As we approach the terminator, Fredo, with some fairly high crater
walls and high country - with these long shadows, it really looks rugged. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:47:10 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:47:21 Haise:</b> Yes. Guess right about the terminator; you're starting to look into the
eastern edge of the Fra Mauro formation. Is that what it looks like, Ed?<p>

<b>083:47:32 Mitchell:</b> Yes, that's it. That's affirmative, Fredo. Unfortunately, the landing
site, I think, is definitely in darkness. It's probably a little bit too far to the south for us
to even see that area too well. A crater, Gambart, we can just see the - the Gambart - we can just
see the eastern rim of it. The western rim is just barely lighted, but the
rest of it's in darkness.<p>

<b>083:48:00 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed.<p>

<b>083:48:06 Shepard:</b> Of course, this Sun angle makes it pretty obvious [Garbled] deposit of
some kind. You can see the difference in texture very easily from a low Sun angle.<p>

<b>083:48:17 Haise:</b> Roger, Al.<p>

<b>083:48:20 Mitchell:</b> That's affirmative. You can see the streaks - the streaks that we've
talked about are really there. They seem to lead right back toward the Imbrium
area and the Copernican area. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:48:39 Mitchell:</b> That's the most stark - desolate-looking piece of
country I've ever seen.<p>

<b>083:48:51 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed.

<blockquote>[Comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>083:49:57 Mitchell:</b> We're almost directly over the terminator now, Fredo. And looking right
down into these craters and these features that are right on the terminator. And even knowing it,
it is a terminator, and knowing what you're supposed to see, it's very difficult to make out
exactly what you are looking at.<p>

<b>083:50:18 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:51:03 Mitchell:</b> With our current dark adaptation, it looks like you could walk along
that surface into the darkness and fall into nothing. There's absolutely nothing there. Perhaps
when we are some - a little better dark adapted, you see Earth - features in
earthshine, but we can't right now.<p>

<b>083:51:20 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:51:47 Roosa:</b> Hey, Fredo, we sure picked a clear day to arrive; there's not much haze in
the air at all. We can see all the way to the horizon.<p>

<b>083:51:56 Haise:</b> Incredible. [Long pause]<p>

<b>083:52:47 Mitchell:</b> I guess we better make the boss happy and get on with the chow.
[Garbled] knock off our descriptions at this point.<p>

<b>083:52:57 Haise:</b> Okay, Ed, you'll get another chance to look at it a
couple of Revs later, a little lower.<p>

<b>083:53:08 Mitchell:</b> Roger. There sure is a lot to see. You could spend
a lot of time talking about it.<blockquote>[Very long comm break.]</blockquote>

<b>084:35:57 Mitchell (onboard):</b> [Garbled] Myrtle here.<p>

<b>084:36:02 Shepard (onboard):</b> We still want to do a B/D roll, won't we?<p>

<b>084:36:05 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes, might as well.<p>

<b>084:36:07 Shepard (onboard):</b> I'm going to load 2110. Okay?<p>

<b>084:36:14 Roosa (onboard):</b> Before you - Hold it just a second before you Enter. Let me do
that one more time, just to make sure we didn't get out of - Okay. Now enter it. Okay.<p>

<b>084:36:27 Shepard (onboard):</b> What did you do that for?<p>

<b>084:36:29 Roosa (onboard):</b> Well, see, we're in a 5-degree dead band.<p>

<b>084:36:30 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>084:36:32 Roosa (onboard):</b> If you change that - if you change that to a narrow dead band,
it will immediately fire and bring you over to the center of that 5-degree dead band. What cycling
this to Free and Auto does is - it centers the dead band.<p>

<b>084:36:44 Shepard (onboard):</b> I already did it once before I called up the 43 [Garbled] ...<p>

<b>084:36:46 Roosa (onboard):</b> Well, I was noticing the roll - the drift up. See, you're going
to a - a half a degree dead band ...<p>

<b>084:36:51 Shepard (onboard):</b> [Garbled] drifted off.<p>

<b>084:36:53 Roosa (onboard):</b> ... so, anything - more than a half a degree
will cause a jet to fire.<p>

<b>084:36:56 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes, okay. It was off half a degree?<p>

<b>084:36:59 Roosa (onboard):</b> Well, you know, what - what's a half a
degree. It was off a little bit.<p>

<b>084:37:03 Shepard (onboard):</b> The att - it was actually rolling apparently.<p>

<b>084:37:07 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes, we're - you know, we're - we were drifting in a 5-degree
dead band. It's just that I'm real - See, we just had a firing there. Yes, after we sat there and
talked about it. It's - it's the Pro on that 21101. Son of a gun. See, we just
wasted some gas. We were talking about it.<p>

<b>084:37:36 Shepard (onboard):</b> We were talking [Garbled] ?<p>

<b>084:37:39 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes. But see, if you're moving, you've established it at that
point. But then, if you're drifting along - and I should have remembered that, as many times as
I've [Garbled] watched that. Anyway, you Enter; and then when you Pro on - on the 21101, what
you're doing is, you're shrinking your phase plane now to a half a degree dead
band. But you don't change the center.<p>

<b>084:38:09 Shepard (onboard):</b> You change your center by going to Free ...<p>

<b>084:38:10 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>084:38:11 Shepard (onboard):</b> ... and back to Auto.<p>

<b>084:38:14 Roosa (onboard):</b> See, we had already drifted out, because we got the firing.<p>

<b>084:38:16 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes. Okay. Well, we should have ...<p>

<b>084:38:18 Roosa (onboard):</b> Just before we PROed ...<p>

<b>084:38:19 Shepard (onboard):</b> Just before you PROed ...<p>

<b>084:38:20 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>084:38:21 Shepard (onboard):</b> ... not - not just before you Enter.<p>

<b>084:38:23 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>084:38:24 Shepard (onboard):</b> You had the right idea, but you did it the wrong way.<p>

<b>084:38:26 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes. Kind of.<p>

<b>084:38:29 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay. We're supposed to start the landmark
tracking [Garbled] here.<p>

<b>084:38:41 Roosa (onboard):</b> Okay.<p>

<b>084:38:42 Shepard (onboard):</b> You can do that now [Garbled.]<p>

<b>084:38:44 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>084:38:52 Shepard (onboard):</b> Plus zero. [Garbled] if we load it that way?<p>

<b>084:42:08 Roosa (onboard):</b> Isn't that something? We - we got so shocked by looking up and

<b>084:44:00 Roosa (onboard):</b> Oh, well - yes, the - at least as my - far as my Solo Book goes,
the <a href="acron.html#aos"><font color=#602020>AOS</font></a>/<a href="acron.html#los"><font color=#602020>LOS</font></a> was in a minute of - shown in the - on my Solo Book.<p>

<b>084:44:09 Mitchell (onboard):</b> [Garbled.]<p>

<b>084:44:10 Roosa (onboard):</b> All they do is read me the 180 time. So that's probably what
they were doing here. In fact, I may have said that. If anybody would say that I said that, I
would agree with them. [Garbled] not anywhere around the points of the Moon, are they?<p>

<b>084:44:37 Mitchell (onboard):</b> No [Garbled] can say what way we're pointing.<p>

<b>084:44:40 Shepard (onboard):</b> We'll be up in the air, because the optics
will be pointed down.<p>

<b>084:44:44 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>084:44:45 Roosa (onboard):</b> Man, let me see. I need to see the what

Following the <a href="acron.html#doi"><font color=#206020>DOI</font></a> burn the vehicle is maneuvered to the
required attitude for a possible preplanned contingency burn
called the bail out burn. Initial burn attitude is such
that the vehicle is pitched up some 73 degrees above the

burn time, this is at acquisition of signal plus 12 minutes.
Assuming the likelihood that the bail out burn will not be
required, the command and service module is maneuvered to
an attitude which allows the visual observation of landmark,

<b>086:34:27 Roosa (onboard):</b> We're going to wait until he calls zero, and
then move the switches.<p>

<b>086:34:32 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay.<p>

<b>086:34:36 Roosa (onboard):</b> I'll not try to have them off at the time he says zero.<p>

<b>086:34:40 Shepard (onboard):</b> All right.<p>

<b>086:34:42 Mitchell (onboard):</b> If you do that, the <a href="acron.html#gn"><font color=#602020>G&N</font></a> and I are

overburn more than 3/10ths.<p>

<b>086:35:04 Roosa (onboard):</b> What's our ullage on this one?<p>

<b>086:35:10 Roosa (onboard):</b> Hey, how's our reading - four - four jets; 14 seconds.<p>

<b>086:35:19 Shepard (onboard):</b> How's our reading on what?<p>

<b>086:35:20 Roosa (onboard):</b> The fuel and oxidizer. What are they?<p>

<b>086:35:24 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Right together; 34.9, 35.1; decreased by

<b>086:40:00 Shepard (onboard):</b> What are you doing down there?<p>

<b>086:40:02 Roosa (onboard):</b> Resting. This is really a comfortable position, mates. Pull on

<b>086:40:18 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Man, I think we're going to sleep tonight.<p>

<b>086:40:25 Roosa (onboard):</b> ... or a Rev and a half.<p>

<b>086:40:26 Mitchell (onboard):</b> About that. Going to clean up, I think,
after <a href="acron.html#doi"><font color=#602020>DOI</font></a>, and we can start getting ready.<p>

<b>086:40:33 Roosa (onboard):</b> No. I think we've got two Revs. We got - because of that bailout
burn and stuff, we didn't get a chance to get Descartes, so ...<p>

<b>086:40:40 Shepard (onboard):</b> ... get the <a href="acron.html#ltc"><font color=#602020>LTC</font></a> on Descartes.<p>

<b>086:40:42 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes, [Garbled] - I take a look at this landmark on this one,
just for <a href="acron.html#ojt"><font color=#602020>OJT</font></a>, because there was nothing else we could do; and we've got to
bring out the Hycon on the next pass around ...<p>

<b>086:40:53 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Get Descartes.<p>

<b>086:40:54 Roosa (onboard):</b> Get Descartes. I'm kind of amazed at the detail you can see ...<p>

<b>086:40:57 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Boy; me, too.<p>

<b>086:40:58 Roosa (onboard):</b> I was looking at all those pictures ...<p>

<b>086:41:00 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Man, it's going to be fun on this one.
Wooo - it's going to be fun on this low pass.<p>

<b>086:41:07 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes. Wow -<p>

<b>086:41:10 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Hey, let's get out - let's grab our <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#602020>LM</font></a>
landmark chart for this low pass.<p>

<b>086:41:19 Roosa (onboard):</b> Okay. We got plenty of time - after the burn?<p>

<b>086:41:26 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>086:41:27 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes, that's right. We've got plenty of
time after the burn. No rush.<p>

<b>086:41:30 Roosa (onboard):</b> I don't think you'll be in a good attitude
to see it on this one - [Garbled.]<p>

<b>086:41:34 Shepard (onboard):</b> Must be so - I've been tracking it and
it's pretty well angled, as I recall.<p>

<b>086:41:40 Roosa (onboard):</b> But after the - on the Hycon pass, the hatch should be toward
Descartes, so we should be able to see something out of these other windows.<p>

<b>086:41:55 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Well, when you were - tracking with a 16-millimeter, I had a
beautiful view out here. Course you - were you rolled?<p>

<b>086:42:06 Roosa (onboard):</b> No.<p>

<b>086:42:07 Mitchell (onboard):</b> You were ...<p>

<b>086:42:08 Roosa (onboard):</b> Well, we're going to be just about the same attitude. Let me see
- this is 292. We're about 8 minutes to the burn - something like that.
[Garbled] You want to do [Garbled.]<p>

<b>086:42:39 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay. You going to start on bank A, and
you're going Direct Thrust, On, if you have to.<p>

<b>086:42:43 Roosa (onboard):</b> No.<p>

<b>086:42:51 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay.<p>

<b>086:42:52 Roosa (onboard):</b> Are you trying to quiz me, or are you ...<p>

<b>086:42:57 Shepard (onboard):</b> (Laughter) Yes.<p>

<b>086:42:58 Roosa (onboard):</b> Well, that's good. Let's make sure we all know what we ...<p>

<b>086:43:00 Shepard (onboard):</b> Be sure you know what you're going to do.<p>

<b>086:43:02 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes. I will bring on bank B, as soon as I can.<p>

<b>086:43:09 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay. [Garbled.]<p>

<b>086:43:12 Roosa (onboard):</b> Let me try that, Edgar. Edgar Allan Poe. Man, I used to love to
read his short stories. He can - he can write about a person being dead better
than anybody I've ever seen.<p>

<b>086:43:34 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes. I guess he was a real - he lead kind
of a tough life, didn't he?<p>

<b>086:43:44 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes. Yes, he - He got a lot of his inspiration coming in and out
of the DTs, I understand. How did you have it? Did you have it hooked like that?<p>

<b>086:43:56 Shepard (onboard):</b> No, I had a strap on it before.<p>

<b>086:43:59 Roosa (onboard):</b> Oh.<p>

<b>086:44:36 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay, Ed. Bring on the Main Bus Ties.<p>

<b>086:44:44 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Okay. There's A ...<p>

<b>086:56:29 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes. It was at the end of the checklist.<p>

<b>086:56:32 Mitchell (onboard):</b> I thought you got to it ...<p>

<b>086:56:56 Roosa (onboard):</b> Hey, while - while we got a couple of minutes, let me go back to
that, if you're through with [Garbled] I want to make a note on that <a href="acron.html#loi"><font color=#602020>LOI</font></a> burn about our <a href="acron.html#pugs"><font color=#602020>PUGS</font></a>
operation because she didn't go as advertised at all.<p>

<b>086:57:16 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Well, the <a href="acron.html#pugs"><font color=#602020>PUGS</font></a> went pretty much as
advertised, except for the crossover, Stu.<p>

<b>086:57:19 Roosa (onboard):</b> That's what I meant. The <a href="acron.html#pugs"><font color=#602020>PUGS</font></a> indication is what I ...<p>

<b>086:57:29 Mitchell (onboard):</b> The crossover was just as smooth as glass.<p>

<b>086:57:42 Mitchell (onboard):</b> As a matter of fact, if I - hadn't realized it was time for
crossover, I'd have still been controlling that thing about a minus 150 at the end of the burn,
because there was no indication of - on the gages at crossover.<p>

<b>086:57:59 Shepard (onboard):</b> You didn't have a high P<sub>C</sub> that time, did you?<p>

<b>086:58:06 Roosa (onboard):</b> No, it - it was about 105. Sounds like to me
it was just - maybe just a tad over.<p>

<b>086:58:09 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay. Everything agreed then. P<sub>C</sub> and
burn time and <a href="acron.html#ems"><font color=#602020>EMS</font></a> and <a href="acron.html#gn"><font color=#602020>G&N</font></a>.<p>

<b>086:58:17 Roosa (onboard):</b> No. There's a "no vote" thing in there [Garbled.]<p>

<b>086:58:20 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Right, no question as far as any of the onboard stuff is
concerned. And that's the way it should be. Hey, look at that.<p>

<b>086:58:30 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay.<p>

<b>086:58:31 Mitchell (onboard):</b> We're back across the terminator.<p>

<b>086:58:33 Roosa (onboard):</b> We're on our way down, this time.<p>

<b>086:58:35 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>086:58:41 Shepard (onboard):</b> You want to [Garbled]?<p>

<b>086:58:43 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>086:58:44 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay.<p>

<b>086:58:53 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Are we maneuvering? We completed everything?<p>

<b>086:58:56 Roosa (onboard):</b> No, we haven't half completed. We've got a
hell of a long way to go.<p>

<b>086:59:01 Shepard (onboard):</b> [Garbled] the bailout attitude.<p>

<b>086:59:03 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>086:59:13 Shepard (onboard):</b> We don't have your time. You screwed that up.<p>

<b>086:59:16 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Pardon? Oh, that's all right. I'm - I'm - Man, we are
noticeably moving across the landscape, now.<p>

<b>086:59:37 Shepard (onboard):</b> Oh, yes. Now we [Garbled.]<p>

<b>086:59:42 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Hey, Al; grab our damned <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#602020>LM</font></a> cards, will you?<p>

<b>086:59:47 Shepard (onboard):</b> I don't think you're going to be able to see the landing site.
You'll be able to see stuff around it.<p>

<b>086:59:51 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Well, I'd like to look at it, anyway.<p>

<b>086:59:53 Roosa (onboard):</b> Terminator's not ...<p>

<b>086:59:55 Mitchell (onboard):</b> It's not quite there yet, I know, but I can see the approach.<p>

<b>087:00:04 Shepard (onboard):</b> Which one do you want, Ed?<p>

<b>087:00:06 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Well, we only have one. That's in the <a href="acron.html#lm"><font color=#602020>LM</font></a>
bag, Al. What was that 180-degree time?<p>

<b>087:00:19 Shepard (onboard):</b> We lost it.<p>

<b>087:00:21 Roosa (onboard):</b> 86:53:05.<p>

<b>087:00:28 Mitchell (onboard):</b> 86:53:05. Here we go.<p>

<b>087:00:39 Roosa (onboard):</b> Hey, Al, when you're - there - there's a book in there, my <a href="acron.html#csm"><font color=#602020>CSM</font></a>
Landmark Book; I put it in there for the burn, because I think you - I think it's over toward the
right, maybe toward the back. Way back in there; it'll be about an inch and a
half thick. [Garbled] There we go.<p>

<b>087:01:04 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Put that in there.<p>

<b>087:01:07 Roosa (onboard):</b> Thank you.<p>

<b>087:01:32 Roosa (onboard):</b> Chaplygin, it's a bright crater.<p>

<b>087:01:43 Shepard (onboard):</b> That's a wild view out there, babe.<p>

<b>087:01:46 Roosa (onboard):</b> See the bright crater right on the edge of Chaplygin there, too?
Through my window maybe. See it coming right there? That thing really shows up. See that little
bitty mother? It is really a - it is really a bright thing - in the - in the photo. This is a 2000
- this is really a 2001 epic - it's unreal.<p>

<b>087:02:10 Shepard (onboard):</b> It's a hell of a view. It's coming zipping around, you know
how you do - Just like [Garbled.]<p>

<b>087:02:23 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Okay, Stu, my chart starts with La
Perouse - La Perouse clusters.<p>

<b>087:02:41 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Should be 21 minutes after - 20 sec - 20 minutes.<p>

<b>087:03:05 Unknown crew member (onboard):</b> [Garbled.]<p>

<b>087:03:42 Mitchell (onboard):</b> We should - in a few more minutes.<p>

<b>087:04:08 Roosa (onboard):</b> Man! What a view.<p>

<b>087:04:10 Shepard (onboard):</b> What?<p>

<b>087:04:11 Mitchell (onboard):</b> We're losing our view. We should be
coming up on the Crater Mendeleev.<p>

<b>087:04:17 Shepard (onboard):</b> [Garbled.]<p>

<b>087:04:19 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Pardon? Do you have Mendeleev out your side, Stu?<p>

<b>087:04:25 Roosa (onboard):</b> No, it's off to your - to your right.<p>

<b>087:04:27 Mitchell (onboard):</b> That's right, you couldn't - We're too low for you to be able
to see across. You have - you should be about over Chaplygin.<p>

<b>087:04:33 Roosa (onboard):</b> We're past Chaplygin - we're going right over the Lovelett.<p>

<b>087:04:36 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Are you?<p>

<b>087:04:41 Shepard (onboard):</b> Look at that.<p>

<b>087:04:42 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes. Yes.<p>

<b>087:04:45 Shepard (onboard):</b> Isn't that wild?<p>

<b>087:04:47 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Dellinger and Pannekoek.<p>

<b>087:04:58 Shepard (onboard):</b> Great Caesar's ghost!<p>

<b>087:05:09 Mitchell (onboard):</b> How come we're rolled so far left
[Garbled] now? [Garbled.] antenna ?<p>

<b>087:05:12 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>087:05:24 Shepard (onboard):</b> You get more of a feeling of the elevation
from the [Garbled] here.<p>

<b>087:05:27 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes. Could I crowd you over just a hair,
so I can look out your window?<p>

<b>087:05:31 Shepard (onboard):</b><p>

<b>087:05:32 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Oh. Yes. We're losing all of it now, aren't we?<p>

<b>087:05:59 Roosa (onboard):</b> You know, that - that sharp crater back at Chaplygin was rather
phenomenal. Next time we come across there, if you get a chance to see it - it
looks like it's been draped around the rim.<p>

<b>087:06:09 Shepard (onboard):</b> Draped?<p>

<b>087:06:10 Roosa (onboard):</b> With a - with a darker material. Kind of - It's real fascinating.<p>

<b>087:06:25 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Well, it is pitch black out this window.
I can see stars out this window.<p>

<b>087:06:32 Shepard (onboard):</b> That's good.<p>

<b>087:06:33 Mitchell (onboard):</b> I'll be darned.<p>

<b>087:06:45 Mitchell (onboard):</b> I can see your jets firing, too.<p>

<b>087:06:47 Shepard (onboard):</b> It really must be nice [Garbled] Yes. We're there.<p>

<b>087:06:55 Mitchell (onboard):</b> We were there, huh?<p>

<b>087:06:59 Shepard (onboard):</b> Roger. We are there. Okay, Imbrium.<p>

<b>087:07:03 Roosa (onboard):</b> Oh, that's right.<p>

<b>087:07:06 Shepard (onboard):</b> [Garbled] happy over there?<p>

<b>087:07:08 Roosa (onboard):</b> Not quite at 65 yet. Wonder why it's ...<p>

<b>087:07:12 Shepard (onboard):</b> Three.<p>

<b>087:07:13 Roosa (onboard):</b> Oh, 63; okay, yes; it's there. It - it'll go ahead and die down
- once it's [Garbled] 58 feet.<p>

<b>087:07:53 Shepard (onboard):</b> The scheduled acquisition is at 16:08
[Garbled] maybe get a couple of things going.<p>

<b>087:08:00 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>087:08:04 Shepard (onboard):</b> [Garbled.]<p>

<b>087:08:05 Mitchell (onboard):</b> We're higher. We ought to get there ...<p>

<b>087:08:06 Shepard (onboard):</b> We're a little higher.<p>

<b>087:08:07 Mitchell (onboard):</b> ... a little early.<p>

<b>087:08:08 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes, we're higher, even though we're
slower; we'll probably be a little early.<p>

<b>087:08:17 Mitchell (onboard):</b> What are you coming up on, Stu? Okay. You
- you're coming up on 11:20.<p>

<b>087:08:31 Roosa (onboard):</b> We ought to be able to see [Garbled] out there. We're just about
north of it. You know, it's not as dark - the mare's not as dark as I expected it to be.<p>

<b>087:08:41 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Okay. It's sure darker than I expected it to be. Noticeably
darker. I really didn't expect it to be that - at this altitude or this close - expect to be able
to see that much difference.<p>

<b>087:09:29 Mitchell (onboard):</b> I'm going to see that I'm all set up for this acquisition.
Minus 39; plus 325. Okay. I'm High Gain, Manual, Wide. And 6 minutes away from it.<p>

<b>087:09:56 Shepard (onboard):</b> Oh, it looks good through the sextant.<p>

<b>087:09:59 Roosa (onboard):</b> what?<p>

<b>087:10:01 Shepard (onboard):</b> Sure looks good through the sextant.<p>

<b>087:10:06 Roosa (onboard):</b> Well, I think it's got a reddish tint to it out the window. Sort
of like, you know, the southwest desert. You know, red hasn't been mentioned
before. Do you see Tsiolkovsky over there?<p>

<b>087:10:26 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Oh, sure; that's Tsiolkovsky. Okay. I've got it. Yes. That
mother is black out there, isn't it? And flat. And there are really a lot more
color differences than I expected.<p>

<b>087:10:49 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay. What's that one that we talked about the other time that
had that bench - the bench that looked like a quarry.<p>

<b>087:10:57 Roosa (onboard):</b> Oh, the bright one.<p>

<b>087:10:58 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>087:10:59 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes.<p>

<b>087:11:00 Shepard (onboard):</b> It's got a reddish tint to it. Got a lot of boulders in it,
too. That's a really sharp drop in the - in the walls of that baby - really sharp break.<p>

<b>087:52:29 Fullerton:</b> Loud and clear, Stu.<p>

<b>087:52:33 Roosa:</b> Okay. Well, that turned out to be a piece of cake. At a very low angle,
Ed, located by coming off of points B and BA and about 51:05 or 51:10 on this clock, the elevation
angle was enough that I could pick up Main Street. And, just for your info, using high speed, I
could track it just smooth as glass all the way through even though we're in inertial attitude.
And, it looks relatively easy. I think 14-2 ought to really be a piece of cake. [Long pause]<p>

<b>087:53:14 Fullerton:</b> Roger; sounds good. [Long pause]<p>

<b>087:53:36 Roosa:</b> Gordon - the optics, even at this low altitude, tracking the landmarks is

<b>087:54:24 Roosa:</b> Okay. Well, it - I think it was right on the money. When they first came
up, it was pretty bright, and the background release on H-3, that ridge right behind it, did not
show up out in the flat surface as much as I would have hoped. And, of course, I've got the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>
there, too. I couldn't pick it up until the trunnion got down to about 31 or 32 degrees. The
optics were right in the area. I think they were a little high. But, I came off, like I say, off
of Mosting B and BA, and got - I picked it up at a fairly low elevation, I believe. And, then as
soon as we came upon them a little bit, why we're right there. And, then I - then I tracked them
with the high speed and I never gave it back to the <a href="acron.html#cmc">CMC</a>. [Long pause]<p>

<b>088:23:03 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes, beef and gravy.<p>

<b>088:23:24 Roosa (onboard):</b> (Singing)<p>

<b>088:23:39 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes, that must have been the beef and gravy that I ate for
lunch. I guess I'll eat that damn spaghetti.<p>

<b>088:23:45 Shepard (onboard):</b> I'll eat the spaghetti.<p>

<b>088:23:46 Roosa (onboard):</b> No, no; I - I'm not going to bitch about the food. I just won't

<b>088:24:06 Roosa (onboard):</b> Somebody watching my flight plan while we're ...<p>

<b>088:24:11 Shepard (onboard):</b> Watch your what?<p>

<b>088:24:30 Shepard (onboard):</b> Babies stay pretty cool in that stuff - place in there.<p>

<b>088:25:28 Shepard (onboard):</b> We're going to use the hot water only? 33 15 45 27 <a href="acron.html#cmp"><font color=#602020>CMP</font></a> What?<p>

<b>088:28:39 Mitchell (onboard):</b> down to 70.<p>

<b>088:28:40 Shepard (onboard):</b> Flow's down, I don't know.<p>

<b>088:29:54 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Probably ought to start a Verb 49 maneuver.<p>

<b>088:29:58 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay. Now we can do.<p>

<b>088:30:15 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay, it's going to be blunt end forward.<p>

<b>088:30:20 Shepard (onboard):</b> Going to be blunt end forward. [Garbled] changing around.<p>

<b>088:37:15 Roosa (onboard):</b> Huh?<p>

<b>088:37:16 Mitchell (onboard):</b> I told that noisy son of a bitch to float
around somewhere else.<p>

<b>088:37:26 Roosa (onboard):</b> You're not clear enough, I don't know, they got bad acoustics.<p>

<b>088:37:34 Mitchell (onboard):</b> One thing about that, you can just let it
float, and you can always find it.<p>

<b>088:38:36 Roosa (onboard):</b> Why don't you turn it off, there, and save the battery? I need
the switch system. Throw the tape over. Or did you do that?<p>

<b>088:39:34 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Huh?<p>

<b>088:46:23 Roosa (onboard):</b> What?<p>

<b>088:46:24 Shepard (onboard):</b> It calls for front end forward. [Garbled] Down here, later on,

<b>089:41:40 Roosa:</b> All right, Gordon. We took them, changed the - the ranges by the time -
times listed in your call, but there was some strange noises coming out of the - the magazine.
Both - both spools worked, and the frame counter ran, and the FMC worked. But there was sort of a
clacking noise on the - in the magazine. It came on between frames 140 and 180, then went back to
the Normal Mode, and then started again at frame 240, and went until the end of the film pass. And
I'm reading 420 on the counter, was reading 5 when I started. I used five for the checkout. [Long pause]<p>

<b>089:42:29 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Stu. There was - was no change in operation when the - It looked
like it was taking the pictures okay, just the funny noises. Is that all?<p>

<b>089:42:43 Roosa:</b> Yes. It - it - it did - it did look like it was going all right. Like I
say, the film wound up, and the FMC continued to work. However, when I went to Standby at the end,
the FMC kept trying to drive. And, now the Mode switch in Standby, and I turned the power on.
Instead of just getting the one flap over to the side, we'll have the FMC like
you do normally, it wants to keep driving. [Long pause]<p>

<b>089:43:14 Fullerton:</b> Okay. Before you fold it up ...<p>

<b>089:43:16 Roosa:</b> No, belay that, Gordon - Hey, belay that, Gordon. It doesn't - FMC does
not keep driving, but that noise is - is still in there. May - maybe you can hear it here. I'll -
I'll hold the mike down (machinegun-like noise). Okay. I don't know if you can get anything out of
that or not, but that's with the sta - Mode switch in Standby and the power On. And, during that
period of time, the FMC kicked a couple of times. It initially went off to the side like it does
when you apply the power. And then, during that period of time that I had the transmitter down,
the FMC did work twice with the Mode switch in Standby and power switch On. [Long pause]<p>

<b>089:44:08 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Stu, before you fold it all up, if it doesn't get in the way
there, why don't you let me check with the back room and see if there's anything they want you to
- else they want you to look at there, and I'll get back with you.<p>

<b>089:44:26 Roosa:</b> Okay. And, another word here, with the - it did - like I - It worked
normally up until about frame 140. But now, when I turn the power on; Mode, Standby, you get that

counter moves, and we take a picture.<p>

making and breaking. He suggests that you get out a magazine Victor once again and put it on there

the power on prior to start, and we got no noises. And I agree with diagnosis there. It - I'm sure

<b>090:24:20 Roosa (onboard):</b> I think maybe that 65 frames a second is overtaxing the magazine

after it - The vibration [Garbled.]<p>

<b>090:24:43 Roosa (onboard):</b> On - on the camera, during the - during the run. Now, on this

up three or four frames at 65.<p>

<b>090:30:34 Roosa (onboard):</b> Thought I'd do a Verb 37 00. It's going to kill that Verb 79

seconds away from time of acquisition of the spacecraft.

</font>
<b>091:03:02 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 14, Houston. Over.<p>

<b>091:03:08 Roosa:</b> Go ahead, Houston; 14.<p>

<b>091:03:10 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Stu, you're loud and clear. That early <a href="acron.html#aos">AOS</a> on the last Rev was
our mistake. We were misled by a misset clock here in the control room. How did the <a href="acron.html#ltc">LTC</a> look to
you after you tried the new magazine?<p>

<b>091:03:30 Roosa:</b> Well, I tell you what; we ended up with the same trouble; let me - let me
run through and tell you you what it is. Let me get the flight plan out here.<p>

<b>091:03:39 Fullerton:</b> Okay.<p>

<b>091:03:44 Roosa:</b> Okay, I put Mag B on the camera, and I ran it in Standby for about 2 and a
half minutes, and everything worked fine. I then went - shot three frames at about - with the
intervalometer set on 10, and it worked fine. And then, I thought, well, maybe it's the fast-frame
rate; so, I put it on 65 and shot off five or six, and it worked okay. Then, I went to Standby and
then on to Single-Frame and punched the single frame and got the same noise. And then, it started
- the magazine started actuating in - in Standby with the power on. So, I turned the power off,
ran the intervalometer back down to 10, turned the power back on; still had the noise. And the
magazine appears to follow the intervalometer setting, but it may do this on a random fashion
while in Standby. And it does move the film, or at least the - both spools move and the counter
moves. And it had that same clacking sound - not really a clacking sound, but I guess it's kind of
hard to describe; maybe that's as good a term as any. And so, I turned the magazine off. By this
time, I had shot 20 - 20 frames - 23 frames and decided that was enough film to waste. I really
didn't mean to use that many, but I was trying to check out that 65-per-minute
intervalometer setting. [Long pause]<p>

<b>091:05:36 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Stu, that's a good summary of what you did. Personally, I more
mystified than before. And we'll let them work on that some more.<p>

<b>091:05:49 Roosa:</b> Okay, I guess, in summary, we got the same problem with both magazines.
Now - maybe the film is working all right; maybe we are just getting - getting a strange noise in
there on the gears or the clutch as you suggested. But we've ended up now with
both magazines having the same symptom.<p>

<b>091:06:13 Fullerton:</b> Roger, understand. We'll think about it while you are sleeping, I
guess, and maybe have some fresh ideas in the morning. For your general information, the - Your
pericynthion was slightly high, but it seems to be coming down faster than we anticipated it would
with each Rev; with the result that at <a href="acron.html#pdi">PDI</a> time, you ought to be right on the money, as near as we
can tell. So it's pretty good work on that point. [Long pause]<p>

<b>091:06:54 Roosa:</b> Okay, that sounds real good; I guess I - I was a little surprised at the
0.6 residual from the <a href="acron.html#gn">G&N</a>. You know, the impulse burn was a little lower than that, but I guess
somebody - it doesn't bother anybody. And, yes, it looked like a real great burn to us, and it
sounds like good news about being right there for <a href="acron.html#pdi">PDI</a>.<p>

<b>091:07:19 Fullerton:</b> Okay, and one thing for Ed: his biosensor seems to be acting up. We'd
like him at his convenience, some time before suiting up tomorrow, to go through the same sort of
checkout that Al did earlier in the flight on his sensors. Over. [Long pause]<p>

<b>091:07:42 Roosa:</b> Okay, I'll pass that on to Ed.<p>

<b>091:07:47 Fullerton:</b> Okay, that's all I have on my list at the moment. Over.<p>

<b>091:07:57 Roosa:</b> Okay, I guess we've got nothing else here. We're going to try to get
secured for the big day tomorrow, and we'll be seeing you in the morning.<p>

<b>091:08:07 Fullerton:</b> Okay, I'll make one check to make sure we haven't got anything else
before we shut up and let you get some sleep.<p>

<b>091:08:17 Roosa:</b> Okay. [Long pause]<p>

<b>091:08:33 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Stu. One - one other thing. We did get that E - E - E-MOD before
we went <a href="acron.html#aos">AOS</a>, okay; and, I guess - Wait I just think there - there is one thing. Just stand by. [Long pause]<p>

<b>091:08:52 Fullerton:</b> Okay, we would like you to turn the optics off tonight. That should do
it. Get a good rest there. Over.<p>

<b>091:09:02 Roosa:</b> Roger; we'll get the optics off before we go to sleep, and we've been
doing that. And yes, I guess, if you've got any other questions on that - on the Hycon, I'd
entertain them now to help you with the troubleshooting, but that's about it.
We'll see you tomorrow.<p>
