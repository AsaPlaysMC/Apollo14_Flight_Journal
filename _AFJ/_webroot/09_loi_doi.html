<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control Houston at 69 hours 47 minutes now in the flight of Apollo 14. We presently show the Apollo 14 spacecraft at a distance of 27 999 nautical miles [51,854 km] away from the moon. And travelling at a speed of 3353 feet per second [1,022 m/s]. We've had no contact with the crew now well into their rest period since our last report. However, in Mission Control, Flight Director, Pete Frank, has been holding discussions with Mr. Sig Sjoberg, Director of Flight Operations and Mission Director, Chet Lee and other , about the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> battery test being considered. This - a test on <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> battery number five which had shown a low readout during the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> house-keeping activities early this morning. Battery number five voltage reading, both on the ground and through - crew readout read 36.7 volts, the normal reading is 37 volts. The proposed test would aid in determining if this in fact is a fault of the battery or an instrumentation or sensor problem. It has not yet been decided when the test may be held either at <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> activation or before. We're at 69 hours 49 minutes <a href="acron.html#get">GET</a>, and we will shortly be undergoing a shift hand over in Mission Control, and a change of shift news conference will be held between the hours of 12:30 and one o'clock. This is Apollo Control Houston."</div>
<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 70 hours 22 minutes. The crew still has a little over 4 and a half hours remaining in this rest period. At the present time we are in the process of completing the shift hand over. Flight director Milton Windler getting briefed by the off going flight director Pete Frank. Windler will shortly be going around the room and checking on the mission status with each of his flight controllers reviewing the status of the mission. At this point, a change of shift news briefing is scheduled to occur in the main auditorium of building 1. As soon as the shift hand over is completed, our best estimate on that at the present time would be about 15 minutes. At 1:30 a Sky Lab Briefing is scheduled. That briefing if the news conference runs long will follow immediately after the change of shift news conference. And it will also be held in the main auditorium of building 1. At the present time we show Apollo 14 traveling at a velocity of 3366 feet per second [1,026 m/s] and 26 819 nautical miles [49,669 km] from the moon. At 70 hours 23 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston."</div>
<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 73 hours 12 minutes. We're still considering the possibility of having the crew reenter the lunar module, following their sleep period to run a test on the ascent battery, which is showing, at last check a slightly below normal open circuit voltage. No decision has been made at this time as to whether or not that will be done ahead of the flight plan. If it is decided to run the check, it would most likely be performed following the midcourse correction 4 and before the lunar orbit insertion. The midcourse correction 4 is currently scheduled at 77 hours 38 minutes. The maneuver will be performed at this time, anyway, with the <a href="acron.html#sps">SPS</a>, the Service Propulsion System engine. The current velocity change required appears to be about 3.6 feet per second [1.1 m/s]. That could be performed with the service propulsion system using a minimum impulse burn of about .6 of a second. The crew has a little bit more then 1 hour 45 minutes remaining in their rest period. We plan to let them sleep the full time if they so desire. Flight Director Milton Windler checked with the Flight Activities Officer a short while ago to see if it would be possible to extend the sleep period if the crew is still sleeping at the end of the period, and the Flight Activities Officer replied that it would be possible to extend it by as much as about 30 minutes and still not run into any problems getting the midcourse correction performed on time. We have a video tape of last nights television of the lunar module housekeeping, which we prepared to replay at this time. The video replay will be in black and white, in order to minimize wear on the tapeheads of the color converter, and we'll play that video tape back at this time."</div>
<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 74 hours 12 minutes. We now have about 47 minutes remaining in the crew rest period. Around the Flight Directors console, for the past 45 minutes or so, there have been a series of group discussions on the procedures that are being worked out for checking out the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> ascent battery. Flight Director Milton Windler advised the Flight Controllers of the progress of the discussions a short while ago. He said at this time, we still do not have a decision as to whether or not we'll attempt to get into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> and check out the battery, although he said, we do appear to be moving in that direction. If the crew is advised to enter the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> and run the test on the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>
battery, it would be done after midcourse correction 4 which is scheduled to occur at about 77 hours 38 minutes. We would like to have the crew completed with activities in the lunar module and back in the command module by about 80 hours to allow adequate time for the lunar orbit insertion maneuver, which is scheduled to occur at about 82 hours 38 minutes. At the present time we show Apollo 14 traveling at a velocity of 3487 feet per second [1,063 m/s]. Now 19068 nautical miles [35,314 km] from the moon. At 74 hours 14 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston"</div>
<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 74 hours, 52 minutes. The Apollo 14 crew is scheduled to end its rest period in about 10 - about 8 minutes from this time. We are prepared to let the crew sleep an additional 30 minutes if they so desire. When the crew is awake we plan to discuss with them procedures for checking out battery 5 in the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>
ascent stage and if the crew concurs we will have them re-enter the Lunar Module at about 78 hours to run the test on battery 5. Essentially the way the test is planned is to have the battery 5, which is hooked to the Lunar Module pilots bus in the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>, remove from that bus and attach to the commanders bus where the open circuit voltage can be measured with another sensor. If the sensor on that bus again measures the slight decrease in voltage that was shown on the Lunar Module Pilot bus, that is about 36.7 volts as opposed to 37 volts, the battery will be - the reading will be verified by putting the battery 6 back on the Commanders bus and comparing the reading on that battery and if in fact a difference does exist between the two batteries and battery 5 continues to show a lower reading, it will be tested under LOAD and by putting some equipment on line and we'll be watching to see if the batteries share the load equally and if battery 5 is able to maintain full output or able to hold up to 2 amps of load - under load. This procedure will be discussed with the crew and others and if the crew concurs, the <a href="acron.html#ivt">IVT</a> into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>, the intravehicular transfer to the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> will occur at about 78 hours. At the present time we show Apollo 14 17,671 nautical miles [32,727 km] from the moon. The spacecraft velocity is 3,518 feet per second [1,072 m/s]. We'll continue to stand by live from this point on for word from the crew that they are up or in the event that we don't hear from them in 5 minutes or so when they are scheduled to awake in about 30 minutes when the Capcom would put in a call. At 74 hours, 56 minutes - 55 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston, standing by."</div>
<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 75 hours, 30 minutes. We're nearing the end now of the 30 minute extension to the crew's sleep period and we expect that Capcom, Bruce McCandless will be putting in a call shortly to the crew. At the present time Apollo 14 is 16,433 nautical miles [30,434 km] from the moon. The spacecraft velocity has increased now to 3,549 feet per second [1,082 m/s]."</div>
<div class="pao">Our communications engineer reports that we're getting carrier downlink from the spacecraft indicating that the crew is up and about and preparing to give us a call. So we'll continue to stand by for that."</div>

<div><b>075:48:00 Mitchell:</b> Houston, 14. Do you read me?</div>
<div><b>075:48:03 McCandless:</b> Roger, 14. Reading you loud and clear now. We had another antenna switch. Over.</div>
<div><b>075:48:10 Mitchell:</b> Roger. I lost you after the first hydrogen tank.</div>
<div><b>075:48:14 McCandless:</b> Okay. Hydrogen tank 1, 72.4, 72.8; oxygen, 89, 87, 38. Over. [Long pause]</div>

<div><b>075:49:16 McCandless:</b> Roger. Are you all eating breakfast up there now?</div>
<div><b>075:49:19 Mitchell:</b> Our - We're starting. The cooks are in the kitchen at the moment. Our radiation readings for last night - or rather for this morning are 16045 for Al, 1042 - 01042 for Stu, and 05038 for Ed. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>075:49:46 McCandless:</b> Roger. 16045 for Al, 01042 for Stu, 05038 for Ed, and how about quantity of sleep? Do you have any comments on that? Over.</div>
<div><b>075:50:00 Mitchell:</b> Roger. For Al, 6 hours; Stu, 6-1/2; and for Ed, 6-1/2. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>075:50:14 McCandless:</b> Roger, Ed. And Ed, when you - when you all feel prepared, we've got quite an extensive batch of paperwork to pass up to you here.</div>
<div><b>075:50:29 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Bruce. Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>075:50:32 McCandless:</b> Roger.</div>
<div><b>075:50:36 Mitchell:</b> Is it all going to be associated with the flight plan?</div>
<div><b>075:50:39 McCandless:</b> Well, let's see. We got - we got a comment on the T<sub>ephem</sub>. We've got a flight-plan update. We've got a docking probe status report. We've got a pericynthion plus 2 abort pad. We will have an <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> abort chart in numbers - criterion update. We'll have some questions for you on the cosmic ray flashes. And when it comes in, we'll have a procedure for you for checking out the ascent stage battery number 5 in the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>075:51:14 McCandless:</b> Also the sports news and commentary on midcourse 4.</div>
<div><b>075:51:21 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Why don't we get the flight plan first, so that we can kind of see where we're going. And then we'll string the others out throughout and after breakfast.</div>
<div><b>075:51:32 McCandless:</b> Okay. Actually, I think you were looking over my shoulder, because the flight-plan update is about the simplest of the whole bunch. What we're aiming towards here ...</div>
<div><b>075:51:44 Mitchell:</b> We are looking over your shoulder.</div>
<div><b>075:51:48 McCandless:</b> (Laughter) What we're aiming towards here is getting you into the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>
shortly after midcourse correction 4 - to do a little more systems detective work on ascent battery 5. Make everybody feel a little warmer down here. And, of course, the rest of the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> is still in 4 0 shape. At 76 hours in the flight plan, we'd like you to pressurize the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> as required. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>075:52:34 Mitchell:</b> Okay. 76 hours, pressurize the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> as required.</div>
<div><b>075:52:38 McCandless:</b> Roger. At 77 hours, plus 45 minutes, which is right after midcourse 4, maneuver to Moon-view attitude. And that attitude is presently contained in the flight plan at 78 plus 55 and is roll 352, 110, 311. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>075:53:16 Mitchell:</b> Roger. Maneuver to Moon-view attitude, and say again the angles. I understand that's at 77:45, right after midcourse 4.</div>
<div><b>075:53:24 McCandless:</b> Roger. Angles are 352, 110, 311, and they're currently in the flight plan at 78 plus 55. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>075:54:14 McCandless:</b> You still there, Ed?</div>
<div><b>075:54:22 Mitchell:</b> That's affirmative. Okay, I have moved it from 78:55 to 77:45.</div>
<div><b>075:54:28 McCandless:</b> Roger. And this is a good attitude for <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> communication on Aft Omni. And the procedure that we'll have for you later on will have the S-band up for telemetry but not for voice, so you want to use Aft Omni? At 78 hours, or from 78 hours to 80 hours even, we have blocked out for <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> checkout of the ascent batteries so you can plan on <a href="acron.html#ivt">IVT</a> to the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> at about 78 hours and be back out by 80. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>075:55:05 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Understand that the attitude we're going to is good for the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>
Aft Omni, and we will <a href="acron.html#ivt">IVT</a> to the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> at 78 hours for a battery-5 checkout and be back - plan to be hack by 80 hours.</div>
<div><b>075:55:19 McCandless:</b> Roger. And meanwhile, back in the command module, Stu can press on with the rest of the normal command module activities, such as the <a href="acron.html#p52">P52</a> and all that.</div>
<div><b>075:55:30 Mitchell:</b> Okay. You're going to have some good words on the ascent battery 5 for me, you say, in a little while.</div>
<div><b>075:55:37 McCandless:</b> Yes, indeed. Joe Engle was just over in the <a href="acron.html#lms">LMS</a> here in Houston running through the thing, and it's a fairly - fairly long procedure as far as handwriting goes, but relatively straightforward, and we'll cover it for you in detail.</div>
<div><b>075:55:56 Mitchell:</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="pao">Joe Engle is the Lunar Module Pilot on the backup crew."</div>
<div><b>075:56:02 McCandless:</b> Would you like a general breakdown on what we plan to do?</div>
<div><b>075:56:09 Mitchell:</b> I'll stand by until you're ready to read it out, but maybe you can give me a summary before.</div>
<div><b>075:56:13 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>075:56:25 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Ready for the next item.</div>
<div><b>075:56:27 McCandless:</b> Okay. This is the docking probe status summary. The conclusion down here is that, on your final successful attempt, the probe's spring started to compress slightly, followed by capture latch engagement. And the dock latch went barber pole, and then the bottle fired and retraction was normal, although the time was somewhat shorter due to the continued firing of the service module <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a>. The talkback operation during initial extension and final docking plus the accelerometer data, the capture latch release mode occurrence during the extensions, all indicated normal extension, capture, and retract sequence. Some consideration was given to the possibility that the <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> thrusting compressed the probe until the docking latches engaged, but this would have required more force than the <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> provides. As we mentioned yesterday, we are still Go for the mission. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>075:57:34 Mitchell:</b> Okay. And I think I'd like to have you repeat that after Al and Stu get on the headsets so that I won't have to write the whole thing down. I think they'd like to hear it.</div>
<div><b>075:57:43 McCandless:</b> Okay. How about a pericynthion ... [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>075:58:24 Mitchell:</b> Go ahead, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>075:58:26 McCandless:</b> Okay, Ed. We're getting a lot of noise on the downlink right now. Let's stand by until after we shift antennas again..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div class="pao">Astronauts Dick Gordon, Pete Conrad, Joe Engle and Phil Chapman are currently on the Capcom console with Capcom Bruce McCandless. And we're continuing to get quite a bit of noise on the downlink as we - as the spacecraft rotates from one OMNI antenna to the next."</div>
<div><b>076:00:09 McCandless:</b> Okay, 14. How do you read now?</div>
<div><b>076:00:15 Mitchell:</b> Loud and clear, now, Bruce. Okay, our status at the moment - we're going to hold the probe report until Al and Stu get on the headsets. Let's press on. What's the next thing you have?</div>
<div><b>076:00:26 McCandless:</b> Okay. Pericynthion plus 2 abort pad, standing by; P30. [Long pause]</div>
<div class="pao">The pericynthion plus 2 abort pad, which McCandless is preparing to read up to the crew is an abort maneuver which would be available to the crew to perform if for some reason they were unable to go into lunar orbit."</div>
<div><b>076:00:55 McCandless:</b> Are you ready for the P30 pericynthion plus 2, Ed?</div>
<div><b>076:01:04 Mitchell:</b> Okay. <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> plus 2.</div>
<div><b>076:01:07 McCandless:</b> Roger. Pericynthion plus 2 abort pad. <a href="acron.html#sps">SPS</a>/<a href="acron.html#gn">G&N</a>, 63, 300, plus 0.90, minus 0.33; T<sub>ig</sub>, 084:35:20 ... [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:01:32 Mitchell:</b> Bruce, hold it a minute. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:02:03 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Would you start over again now for me, please?</div>
<div><b>076:02:06 McCandless:</b> Wilco, Ed. This is a pericynthion plus 2 abort pad. <a href="acron.html#sps">SPS</a>/<a href="acron.html#gn">G&N</a>, 63, 300, plus 0.90, minus 0.33, T<sub>ig</sub>, 084:35:20.03, minus 0711.5, minus 0053.1, minus 1276.8, roll N/A, 084 pitch, yaw N/A. The rest of the pad is N/A. This is an <a href="acron.html#sps">SPS</a> docked burn and the attitudes are based on the landing site <a href="acron.html#refsmmat">REFSMMAT</a>. Read back. Over..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>076:03:25 Mitchell:</b> Okay. It's pericynthion plus 2. <a href="acron.html#sps">SPS</a>/<a href="acron.html#gn">G&N</a>, 63, 300, plus 0.90, minus 0.33, 84:35:20.03, minus 0711.5, minus 0053.1, minus 1276.8, roll N/A, pitch 084, yaw N/A, or is that 000. The rest of the pad is N/A. <a href="acron.html#sps">SPS</a> docked, landing site <a href="acron.html#refsmmat">REFSMMAT</a>. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:04:07 McCandless:</b> Roger. I now have your midcourse-4 pad. I - I think you're losing ground on me down here. They seem to be piling up faster than we can get them read up.</div>
<div><b>076:04:18 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Bruce, on the angles on that one. The roll was N/A, pitch was 84, and yaw was zero. Is that correct?</div>
<div><b>076:04:25 McCandless:</b> Yaw was N/A. Actually, if you want the numbers, roll would be 356 and yaw would be 009. We understood there was a previous agreement that you were just going to use pitch for checking, and you would take the roll and yaw as computed by P40. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:04:51 Mitchell:</b> Okay. All right, press on.</div>
<div><b>076:05:00 McCandless:</b> Okay. Let me hold off on this midcourse-4 pad a minute. I can give you just a second's worth of discussion on the thing. It's coming out to 3.8 feet per second, and this is very close to your <a href="acron.html#sps">SPS</a> minimum impulse. It'll be 0.69 seconds of burn time compared to your guaranteed 0.50 min impulse, and when you get down to <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a><sub>c</sub> the value of 2/10ths is what they want set in the counter. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:05:43 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Understand that.</div>

<div><b>076:08:49 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston. Readback correct..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>076:10:41 Mitchell:</b> Houston, 14. How do you read now?</div>
<div><b>076:10:48 McCandless:</b> Okay. When you have a chance we'd like <a href="acron.html#p00">P00</a> and Accept Ed. And we'll uplink you the midcourse-4 target load and a new state vector. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:11:23 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Bruce. You have <a href="acron.html#p00">P00</a> and Accept.</div>
<div><b>076:11:29 McCandless:</b> Okay, Ed. You may recall our discussion on T<sub>ephem</sub> last evening, with regard to the sign of the quantity in R<sub>3</sub>. We've had a request down here that you, on the <a href="acron.html#cmc">CMC</a> and <a href="acron.html#lgc">LGC</a>, load in the T<sub>ephem</sub> from the pad that we passed you. That is the - the quantity using all positive signs. Do you still have that handy? [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:12:01 Mitchell:</b> Let me double check. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:12:27 Mitchell:</b> Roger. Those are the numbers 00006, 39223, and 16020. Is that affirmative?</div>
<div><b>076:12:35 McCandless:</b> Roger, that's the one.</div>
<div><b>076:12:39 Mitchell:</b> Okay, we'll load these in after while.</div>
<div><b>076:12:42 McCandless:</b> Let us finish with the uplink first. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:12:57 McCandless:</b> Okay, Ed. We have a - a rather detailed change to the <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> Mode I <a href="acron.html#dps">DPS</a>
abort chart and numerical data. This is found in the flight plan in the Contingency Checklist, and the numerical stuff is on one of your cue cards. It'd probably be easiest if you broke out the flight plan, say, and went through it with me. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:13:30 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Did you get my readback on the midcourse-4 pad?</div>
<div><b>076:13:42 McCandless:</b> Uh ...</div>
<div><b>076:13:49 Mitchell:</b> It sounded to me like you dropped out before I finished reading it back. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:14:04 McCandless:</b> Yes. As far as - as far as I can tell, I got all of it. I recall definitely down through Sirius and Rigel, and I believe I recall your reading the High-Gain Antenna angles back, and I got - so I'll Roger for that.</div>
<div><b>076:14:20 Mitchell:</b> Okay, thank you. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:15:00 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Bruce. Give me a few words on the <a href="acron.html#dps">DPS</a> abort changes before we start giving the actual numbers.</div>
<div><b>076:15:11 McCandless:</b> Okay, you have a change in the <a href="acron.html#dps">DPS</a> <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> available line due to a different engine model, change in the spacecraft weight, and a change in the usable propellant from the time that this curve was calculated. You have a change in the two other lines, which are the <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> plus 2-hour and <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> plus 30-minute abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> based on the change in your orbit from the nominal plan. This all backs up to the 40-minute-late lift-off. And the numerical changes are a consequence of that, also. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:15:56 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Let's start through them slowly then and see if we can correct them.</div>
<div><b>076:16:02 McCandless:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>076:16:08 McCandless:</b> Over here in the <a href="acron.html#dps">DPS</a> <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> available line, the left-hand intercept is at abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of 1966 feet per second at <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of zero. The right-hand intercept on the vertical dashed line comes at an abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of 2130 and the <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of 725. Then connect the two intercepts together with a straight line. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:16:51 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Stand by. The first one is 1966. Let's just take them one at a time, and I'll plot them.</div>
<div><b>076:16:57 McCandless:</b> Roger. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:17:08 Mitchell:</b> And you say the - the right-hand intercept is 21 what ?</div>
<div><b>076:17:14 McCandless:</b> Is 2130, 2130, and it falls on that vertical dashed line at 725. It separates Mode I from Mode II.</div>
<div><b>076:17:27 Mitchell:</b> I got it.</div>
<div><b>076:17:29 McCandless:</b> Okay, connect them up.</div>
<div><b>076:17:37 McCandless:</b> 14, Houston. The computer's yours. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:17:49 Mitchell:</b> Okay, I'm in Block. Give me the next line now.</div>
<div><b>076:17:54 McCandless:</b> Roger. In the <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> plus 2-hour abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> region, the left-hand intercept is at 1477 feet per second. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:18:13 Mitchell:</b> Copy, 1477.</div>
<div><b>076:18:16 McCandless:</b> Roger. And the right-hand end point is at 2026 abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a>, and <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a>
<a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of 238. It should intercept your <a href="acron.html#dps">DPS</a> <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> available line where it crosses the boundary between the Mode I 2 hour and the Mode I 30 minutes. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:18:41 Mitchell:</b> Roger. Took care of that, and let me draw that one.</div>
<div><b>076:18:51 McCandless:</b> Okay. You ready for the next one?</div>
<div><b>076:19:02 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Ready for the next one.</div>
<div><b>076:19:04 McCandless:</b> Okay. Over in the <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> plus 30-minute abort region, the left-hand intercept, with the boundary between Mode I 2 hour and Mode I 30 minutes, occurs at abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a>
of 1517 and <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of 238. Over.</div>
<div><b>076:19:23 McCandless:</b> And we're going down in the mud again, Ed. I'm going to wait for the antenna changeover before we continue with that one.</div>
<div><b>076:19:34 Mitchell:</b> Okay. I've got you at 1517 for the first one..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>076:22:04 McCandless:</b> Okay, 14, Houston. We're coming back in now. I confirm 1517 for the left-hand edge, and the righthand intercept is at abort <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> of 2395 on the 725 <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> magnitude dashed line. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:22:27 Mitchell:</b> 2375. Is that correct?</div>
<div><b>076:22:30 McCandless:</b> Negative. 2395. Over.</div>
<div><b>076:22:35 Mitchell:</b> Okay. 2395. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:23:29 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Bruce. Have that line plotted.</div>
<div><b>076:23:32 McCandless:</b> Okay. And all three of those lines ought to be pretty close to parallel to the existing lines; you concur?</div>
<div><b>076:23:40 Mitchell:</b> Yes, they sure are.</div>
<div><b>076:23:44 McCandless:</b> Okay. Over to the numerical data. Come on over to the - the little block there and, on the second line down under burn time starting out with 0 plus 33, Mode I, loose, it should be zero plus 33 through 1 plus 19, and <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a><sub>M</sub> is 238 through 570. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:24:27 Mitchell:</b> Okay. The burn - the burn - burn time from 033 to 115 should be 033 to 119, and the corresponding <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a><sub>M</sub> is 238 to 570.</div>
<div><b>076:24:43 McCandless:</b> Roger. Next line down. The burn time is 1 plus 19 through 1 plus 40, and the burn time is - or the <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a> M is 570 through 725. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:25:05 Mitchell:</b> Okay. We change from 119 to 140 and <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a><sub>M</sub> is 570 to 725.</div>
<div><b>076:25:14 McCandless:</b> Roger. On the next line down, you change 1 plus 39 to 1 plus 40, so it reads 1 plus 40 through 2 plus 41. Over.</div>
<div><b>076:25:26 Mitchell:</b> Okay. One - The next line is 140 to 241.</div>
<div><b>076:25:30 McCandless:</b> Okay, now down below it, you've got a column for updated times. And I'll read you the updated times.</div>
<div><b>076:25:41 Mitchell:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>076:25:44 McCandless:</b> Okay. <a href="acron.html#get">GET</a> of <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> ignition: 82 plus 36 plus 47, 83 plus 06 plus 47; roll: 127, 264, 348; <a href="acron.html#csm">CSM</a> <a href="acron.html#imu">IMU</a> angles <a href="acron.html#get">GET</a> abort ignition, 84 plus 36 plus 47.

<div><b>076:26:50 Mitchell:</b> Okay. And Bruce, the only time I think I've missed is the <a href="acron.html#csm">CSM</a> <a href="acron.html#imu">IMU</a> angles at <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> plus 30.</div>
<div><b>076:26:59 McCandless:</b> Okay. 83 plus 06 plus 47. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:27:12 Mitchell:</b> Okay.

[Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:27:49 McCandless:</b> Okay, Ed. The readback is correct except that you omitted the roll, pitch, and yaw angles under <a href="acron.html#csm">CSM</a> <a href="acron.html#imu">IMU</a> angles for <a href="acron.html#loi">LOI</a> plus 30.</div>
<div><b>076:28:04 Mitchell:</b> Roger. I didn't hear them. Are they - they the same?</div>
<div><b>076:28:07 McCandless:</b> Okay. Roll and yaw are the same. Pitch has changed from 263 to 264. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>076:28:23 Mitchell:</b> Oh, those. Okay, I thought I read them to you, Bruce. I have them: 127, 264, and 348.</div>
<div><b>076:28:30 McCandless:</b> Roger. Readback is correct, and we've got some news whenever you're ready.</div>
<div><b>076:28:37 Mitchell:</b> Okay. Let's hold off and let the other guys get on the headsets and have some news, while I get some breakfast.</div>
<div><b>076:28:45 McCandless:</b> Okay, and those changes need to be made in the Contingency Checklist, the flight plan, and on your cue card.</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 76 hours 37 minutes. We are beginning a shift hand over at this time. Flight Director Jerry Griffin coming on to replace Flight Director Milton Windler and the capsule communicator on the upcoming shift will be astronaut Fred Haise. We do anticipate a change of shift briefing, probably within about 30 minutes of the shift handover which is scheduled to occur at 7:30. Also during the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> impact, which will be occurring early tomorrow morning at about 1:26 AM central standard time, we will have Dr. David W. Strangway, who is chief of the Geophysics branch at the Manned Spacecraft Center available in the news center briefing room to provide background on the event and also to do what real time data analysis is possible. We will have video from the control center piped into the briefing room and we'll have available such things as video of the seismic data that we are expecting to receive on the Apollo 12 passive seismometer. At the present time we are showing that the impact will occur at a ground elapsed time of 83 hours 17 minutes, 55 seconds, and the current impact coordinates for the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> are 7 degrees, 52 minutes south and 26 degrees 3 minutes west.

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control 77 hours 27 minutes ground elapsed time. Flight Director Gerry Griffin who heads up the gold team of flight controllers is settling in to his chair in the middle of the room and having handover from Flight Director Milton Windler off going shift. Meanwhile aboard Apollo 14 the crew's making preparations for the midcourse correction burn number 4 upcoming in 9 minutes and 45 seconds. That burn with an ignition time of 77 hours 38 minutes 14 seconds will be for a 3.8 feet per second [1.2 m/s] change in velocity. Total burn time is .7 of a second which for that big engine is a wee small burp. The midcourse correction burn number 4 in local time will be 8:01:14 central time. Communications engineers asked that the crew be asked to swivel the high gain antenna for a better lockon upcoming on this burn - apparently the communications is somewhat spotty at this time. We're standing by live on air-ground with Apollo 14 for the upcoming burn."</div>

<div><b>078:06:23 Mitchell:</b> Houston, Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>078:06:25 Haise:</b> Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>078:06:30 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Fredo. I'm through the tunnel and ingressing the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> at this point. What's about the first thing you want me to head for?</div>
<div><b>078:06:40 Haise:</b> Okay, I'll let Joe talk to you here and kind of give you a few words on the big picture. And then we'll start in.</div>
<div><b>078:06:50 Mitchell:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>078:06:52 Engle:</b> Okay, Ed. What this is going to amount to is an abbreviated - a very abbreviated powerup, and we will transfer to <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> power; so, Stu, you can stand by, and we'll get our own times on that. Now, Ed, if we have a comm problem any time during this - and we are out of configuration - just get the activation checklist and go to page 1-17 and complete the deactivation from that point on. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>078:07:41 Engle:</b> And, Ed, if you're ready to go now, we'll start through here.</div>
<div><b>078:07:50 Mitchell:</b> Okay, Joe. How about giving me a quick overall picture of the problem as you saw it from the ground. I didn't see much of anything here that was indicative of a problem.</div>
<div><b>078:07:59 Engle:</b> Okay. Just a second here. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>078:08:14 Engle:</b> Okay, Ed. I wanted to get the values correct here. <a href="acron.html#tm">TM</a> picked up about 3/lOths of a voltage - of a volt low on battery 5, which gave some concern, and, primarily, we just want to verify that perhaps we're not - we don't have a gauge that's giving us that much of a difference, rather than the battery itself. [Long pause] 
<div class="comment">Mission Control really does run a tight ship.  Although being 0.3 volts short of 37 volts means only a very small loss in capacity for a battery that is more than big enough to do the job and that has more than enough backup in case it should fail prematurely. However, 37 volts was the expected value and 36.7 volts was out of tolerance. They treated all problems in vital systems as potential safety problems until they could convince themselves that it was indeed only a minor problem and not an early indication of a serious problem.</div>
<div><b>078:08:40 Mitchell:</b> 3/10ths of a volt?</div>
<div><b>078:08:42 Engle:</b> Yes. That's affirmative. That's open-circuit voltage, Ed.</div>
<div><b>078:08:47 Mitchell:</b> As I recall, we read - Roger. As I recall, we read them off a half a volt different, 36 and a half to 37. Is that right?</div>
<div><b>078:08:57 Engle:</b> Roger, Ed. That was half a volt onboard, and the telemetry showed the 3/10ths down here.</div>
<div><b>078:09:07 Mitchell:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>078:09:08 Engle:</b> Okay. And essentially, Ed, what we're going to do is put the - put both batteries on an open bus to read out both bus and battery voltages. And, if we're not satisfied with the readings at that point, we'll go ahead and load up the <a href="acron.html#lmp">LMP</a> bus and - put a load on it rather - and then check the battery performance both by itself and sharing a load on the <a href="acron.html#lmp">LMP</a> bus.</div>
<div><b>078:09:29 Mitchell:</b> Okay. I understand what you're going to do.</div>
<div><b>078:09:41 Engle:</b> Okay. Let's press on, and I'll read the items off in checklist fashion. And I'll read one or two items at a time, Ed, depending on if they're in the same proximity, and wait for your verification. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>078:10:01 Mitchell:</b> Okay. I'm ready.</div>

<div><b>078:15:43 Mitchell:</b> Well, since we don't have those meters powered up, I don't have anything to tell by.</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control. 78 hours 57 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 14 some 3 hours 26 minutes from loss of signal as it passes behind the moon on the first coasting in to lunar orbit insertion burn coming up later this evening. Lunar Module pilot Ed Mitchell crossed over into the lunar module earlier and just - has completed a checkout of the electrical system in the lunar module in which the concern is on the low ... In which the concern was on the low voltage reading of about 3 tenths of a volt under normal of ascent battery number 5. By selectively switching the various loads back and forth between this battery and the other ascent battery, measuring the load sharing capability, the voltage readings with the various loads, it was determined as mentioned by the acting spacecraft communicator, Joe Engle, that the battery looks okay at this time, and as of now they're go for continuing toward a lunar landing mission. There's an extensive checkout of lunar module systems prior to the undocking and our descent maneuver on up till landing, but as of now, the ascent batteries, especially battery number 5 is go at this time. Some gee whiz numbers, would you believe they've disappeared from my display. At 78 hours 59 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control."</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 79 hours 51 minutes <a href="acron.html#get">GET</a>. The countdown clock showing 2 hours and 45 minutes 37 seconds until lunar orbit insertion ignition and 2 hours 32 minutes until the spacecraft passes behind the moon on the beginning of the first revolution. Earlier, you heard the spacecraft communicator pass up to the crew all the numbers necessary for the lunar orbit insertion burn, which is now scheduled for ground elapsed time of 82 hours 36 minutes 46 seconds with a retrograde of velocity decrease of 3020 feet per second [920 m/s]. The lunar module pilot, Ed Mitchell went into the lunar module earlier in the evening and checked out the electrical system and in watching the telemet - telemeter displays here in Mission Control, Apollo program Director Rocco Petrone made the following comment: "We are happy with what we saw. We haven't found anything to preclude descent. Other ground tests are under way to further verify battery performance. During the test, battery 5 shared the loads applied very well without draining power from battery 6. The battery recovered readily after the load was removed. At one time the load was pushed to 30 amps during the test. The entire <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> battery system will be thoroughly checked out during the power up of the lunar module on descent day. We did however, determine that the .3 of a volt low reading recorded earlier in the mission was not an instrumentation fault." Presently Apollo 14 is 6863 nautical miles [12,710 km] out from the moon increasing in velocity as it falls inward toward lunar orbit. Velocity now reading 4083 feet per second [1,244 m/s]. At 79 hours 53 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control."</div>

<div class="comment">Very long comm break.</div>
<div><b>080:47:04 Shepard:</b> Houston, Apollo 14. We're ready for the discussion of the probe, now.</div>
<div><b>080:47:10 Haise:</b> Okay, Al. Okay, the conclusion down here is that on your final attempt, the probe spring started to compress slightly, followed by the capture latch engagement talkbacks going barber pole. The bottle then fired and the retraction looked normal, although the time was somewhat shorter due to the contingent firing of the command module <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> jets. The talkback operation during the initial extension in the final docking, plus the accelerometer data, and also the look-see at the capture latch release motor currents during the extension, all indicated a normal extension, capture, and retract sequence. Some consideration, Al, was given to the possibility that the <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> thrusting compressed the drogue/probe maybe until the docking latches engaged, but the final word was that this would require more force than the <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> could provide. And I guess the most important fact is - as discussed yesterday, we're Go for the mission.</div>
<div><b>080:47:56 Shepard:</b> Okay. Do you suggest any special docking technique for the final docking and rendezvous?.

<div><b>080:49:34 Haise:</b> Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>080:49:38 Roosa:</b> Okay, could we hit that again, now? I guess I don't understand why - why it didn't work on the other - on the other docking.</div>
<div><b>080:49:52 Haise:</b> Yes, I guess we don't have that answer for you, Stu.</div>
<div><b>080:50:00 Haise:</b> All, all we can say is ...</div>
<div><b>080:50:02 Roosa:</b> Are - are we saying that the ...</div>
<div><b>080:50:07 Haise:</b> Yes. We can't explain the preceding attempts, but all we're saying is that the one that worked looked normal.</div>
<div><b>080:50:22 Roosa:</b> Okay, I guess I disagree with it looking normal, but the probe sure does look good now. Are you saying there's no correlation between the retraction and the - I mean, using the retract bottle and getting the docking? [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>080:50:57 Haise:</b> Stand by 1, Stu. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>080:51:25 Haise:</b> Okay. I'm not sure if I'm answering the question you, you, asked, Stu, but what the data showed is that the - the bottle had fired, and started to pull things in before you all actually worked the switch and maybe you thought the reverse was true. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>080:51:51 Roosa:</b> What? Let me see - say that again, Fred. I don't understand that one.</div>
<div><b>080:52:04 Haise:</b> Okay, I guess there's a distinction in, maybe your impressions, and what the data said was that you did get captured, normally before the bottle was fired. Did you all have a different impression? [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>080:52:24 Roosa:</b> Yes. Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>080:52:34 Roosa:</b> Yes, Fred, our impression was that - see the talkbacks going barber pole, which would indicate the capture by the latches - didn't happen until, oh, I think as Al said the other time, several seconds after he hit the Retract switch. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>080:53:04 Roosa:</b> Hey, but we're not trying to talk you out of anything that - we think the probe is - is - fine, we just want to make sure we're clarified on the procedures.</div>

<div><b>082:56:36 Shepard:</b> Okay, Fredo. We had an extremely fine burn, the burn report as follows: burn time, 6 plus 11; residuals, 0.3 plus zero, and zero; <a href="acron.html#deltav">Delta-V</a><sub>c</sub>, minus 7.3; 0351; oxidizer, 349. [Long pause]</div>

<div><b>082:57:47 Shepard:</b> Roger. This is really a wild place up here.</div>
<div><b>082:57:56 Roosa:</b> Hey, Ron, you're not going to believe this. It looks just like the map.</div>

<div><b>083:01:32 Haise:</b> Hey, Stu, that sounds great, by golly. It looks like our orbit - orbital science is off to a good start then.</div>

<div><b>083:04:04 Shepard:</b> Well, this really is a wild place up here. It has all of the grays, browns, whites, dark craters that everybody's talked about before. It's really quite a sight. Ed and Stu are looking at the landmarks to the map, picking up landmarks very easily as we go along the way. And, of course, in the type of orbit we are, the fact that we're climbing away from the surface is very obvious. Of course, that brings more and more of the area in detail. It really is quite a sight. No atmosphere at all; everything is clear up here. Really fantastic. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:05:03 Haise:</b> Roger, Al. We copied, and I think you covered all bets with the colors there.</div>

<div><b>083:06:32 Mitchell:</b> Fredo, the - I think the best description - the description that comes to my mind, we mentioned this when we first looked at this thing, is that it looks like a plaster mold that somebody has dusted with grays and browns, but it looks like it's been molded out of plaster of paris.

<div><b>083:11:56 Haise:</b> Okay..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>083:13:15 Roosa:</b> Okay, we're just now passing over Anagarius and La Perouse. The cone in Behaim is more rounded, I guess, than what I expected - expected to see. [Garbled], you know, was talking about it being large and quite rounded. It is that - it's a little more subdued than what I expected to see. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:13:40 Haise:</b> Roger, Stu. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:13:54 Roosa:</b> And I can see off to my right here Humboldt coming up, and it's just as impressive as it is in the pictures. One thing that strikes me about it is, the dark areas aren't quite as dark, I guess, as I thought, but we're moving in with a reasonably high Sun here, so they're kind of washing out. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:14:54 Haise:</b> And, 14; Houston. Hate to pull you away from the window, but I got a map update and a flight-plan update when you get a chance.</div>

<div><b>083:17:50 Mitchell:</b> Fredo, as interesting as this is from orbit, it sure makes one eager to get - to want to get at Cone Crater now. I'll bet it's wild down there. 
<div class="comment">Cone crater is both the prominent landmark and main goal of their forthcoming landing.</div>
<div><b>083:18:07 Haise:</b> Okay, I missed your first there, Ed. What'd you say about Cone Crater?</div>
<div><b>083:18:13 Mitchell:</b> I said, as interesting as this is from orbit, all it does is whet your appetite to get to Cone Crater.</div>
<div><b>083:18:21 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed.</div>
<div><b>083:18:29 Shepard:</b> I guess in 3 days I haven't brainwashed him where the real science is done, Fredo.</div>

<div><b>083:18:46 Shepard:</b> His arms aren't long enough to bring him back from there.</div>
<div><b>083:18:49 Roosa:</b> Okay, you can really get the attitude rate as we're climbing up here to apogee, Houston, and we're climbing right up with Langrenus there.</div>
<div><b>083:19:02 Haise:</b> Roger, Stu. And we just had <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> impact.</div>
<div><b>083:19:10 Roosa:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:19:33 Roosa:</b> And we're - you get the feeling here, climbing up, that we're almost going up vertically here over Langrenus. It's staying right in the window and that rooster tail coming out of Petavius B is very evident as it swings up across and passes up by Langrenus.</div>
<div><b>083:19:55 Haise:</b> Roger, Stu. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:20:36 Mitchell:</b> From this particular location, looking out the window number 5, you can see the upper end of the Sea of Fertility, and it's interesting that the only way I can tell the demarc - line of demarcation is an albedo change. At this moment, I can't tell you what causes the albedo change except - it's not apparent - except that the Sea of Fertility is much darker and then it changes into the much lighter region up to the north.

<div><b>083:31:31 Haise:</b> Let's hope Cone and Triplet and Doublet show up the same way.</div>
<div><b>083:31:41 Mitchell:</b> You're right..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>083:32:52 Roosa:</b> Hey, Fredo, my first impression as I - How do you read, Fred?</div>
<div><b>083:33:00 Haise:</b> I read you loud and clear, Stu. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>083:33:05 Roosa:</b> Okay. First impression of the Theophilus and Cyrillus is - much difference in age than what I expected. Of course, Theophilus being the younger, but it's much more so than what I really expected - to see, and we hope to get some good photos of the line between the two there; but it's pretty amazing how much more subdued Cyrillus is. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:33:45 Haise:</b> Okay, we copied that, Stu. And, we're up with you on the chart now, too.</div>
<div><b>083:33:54 Roosa:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:34:07 Roosa:</b> Okay. And we're just approaching Descartes now, Fredo. I'm looking out of my rendezvous window, and four of those too-bright craters on either side of the landing site. Just - it's so plain. I guess I'm surprised at the detail - that you can see. Of course, the Sun angle is dropping down a little here, but I thought probably at Descartes, the two bright lead-ins - but - you can see many, many of the fine - the fine craters in between them. And, of course, Dollond, Dollond E, and Kant, they're all just very vivid. But, the - the detail you can see from this altitude of the Descartes sites are rather amazing. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:34:57 Haise:</b> Roger, Stu. I hope the <a href="acron.html#ltc">LTC</a> captures the same detail, a little greater maybe.</div>
<div><b>083:35:08 Roosa:</b> Roger. And it'll he a little lower, too..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>083:37:31 Roosa:</b> Fredo, I - At this point, we're start to pick up a few shadows on the edges of the craters, but the crater chain coming out of Abulfeda - really can't see much difference in albedo between the crater itself and a good bit of the surrounding territory.</div>
<div><b>083:37:48 Haise:</b> Okay, Stu..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>083:39:52 Mitchell:</b> Okay. We're crossing over Albategnius and we can look up and see Ptolemaeus; yes, it's coming in to the hatch window now. That's very stark. I'm very impressed by the different - by albedo differences here, Fredo, that I - that I assume from photographs are really more Sun angle problems or photographic problems. But, by golly, there's some that are really here that I never expected. They must indicate contacts of some sort that may be very subtle on the surface; but I actually believe they're there, if one can find them. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:40:39 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed. Do you mean - you talking in terms of large scale or small scale, like within crater floor?</div>
<div><b>083:40:53 Mitchell:</b> No, I'm thinking of a little larger scale than that. But there are some in the crater floors that are very surprising, too. There's so many things that I assumed from maps were more photographic peculiarities rather than real life, but, by golly, I think they're here.</div>
<div><b>083:41:11 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed.</div>
<div><b>083:41:20 Mitchell:</b> I think, given time, we could find flows and different units that may very well be covered with a great deal of regolith that we - we're seeing suggestions of them in albedo differences and textural differences that are clearly visible from this altitude.</div>
<div><b>083:41:41 Haise:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:41:53 Roosa:</b> I've noticed some lineations in some of the - the big craters that are suggestive of - well, I'm not sure it's of the sloping type of circular lineations that you see in craters. I guess, to be safe, I ought to guess that - so I'll be safe and not say any more. I did see lineations that were surprising to me. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:42:21 Haise:</b> These close to the wall, Ed, or down within the floor of the crater itself?</div>
<div><b>083:42:28 Mitchell:</b> Well, all up and down the wall of a few craters; I don't recall which ones now - back along our track here a few miles. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:43:07 Mitchell:</b> Looking down at the Crater Herschel, for example, Fredo, on the - Let's see, on the western wall. To me, it appears as though it's really a solid chunk from - the rim down to the first slope, or the - where it breaks slope. Of course, this is a long ways away to be talk - making talk like that. However, it seems - it gives one the impression of being very hard solid rock [Garbled.] [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:43:39 Haise:</b> Okay, we copied, Ed. Herschel's west wall looks like essentially one unit.</div>
<div><b>083:43:50 Mitchell:</b> That's affirmative..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>083:45:05 Haise:</b> And, 14; Houston. The 12 seismometers are still going. The traces right now look maybe to be almost neutral.</div>
<div><b>083:45:20 Roosa:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:45:52 Roosa:</b> Okay, Fredo. We just passed over Mosting A, which we'll get a better look at next time around, and the baby crater chain stands out real vividly and just starting to get a pretty low Sun angle here, so any albedo differences about those will be hard to tell now. You can see the dark halo spots along the rilles in Alphonsus, however, very vividly. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:46:23 Haise:</b> Roger, Stu. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:46:44 Mitchell:</b> As we approach the terminator, Fredo, with some fairly high crater walls and high country - with these long shadows, it really looks rugged. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:47:10 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:47:21 Haise:</b> Yes. Guess right about the terminator; you're starting to look into the eastern edge of the Fra Mauro formation. Is that what it looks like, Ed?</div>
<div><b>083:47:32 Mitchell:</b> Yes, that's it. That's affirmative, Fredo. Unfortunately, the landing site, I think, is definitely in darkness. It's probably a little bit too far to the south for us to even see that area too well. A crater, Gambart, we can just see the - the Gambart - we can just see the eastern rim of it. The western rim is just barely lighted, but the rest of it's in darkness.</div>
<div><b>083:48:00 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed.</div>
<div><b>083:48:06 Shepard:</b> Of course, this Sun angle makes it pretty obvious [Garbled] deposit of some kind. You can see the difference in texture very easily from a low Sun angle.</div>
<div><b>083:48:17 Haise:</b> Roger, Al.</div>
<div><b>083:48:20 Mitchell:</b> That's affirmative. You can see the streaks - the streaks that we've talked about are really there. They seem to lead right back toward the Imbrium area and the Copernican area. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:48:39 Mitchell:</b> That's the most stark - desolate-looking piece of country I've ever seen.</div>
<div><b>083:48:51 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed..
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div><b>083:49:57 Mitchell:</b> We're almost directly over the terminator now, Fredo. And looking right down into these craters and these features that are right on the terminator. And even knowing it, it is a terminator, and knowing what you're supposed to see, it's very difficult to make out exactly what you are looking at.</div>
<div><b>083:50:18 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:51:03 Mitchell:</b> With our current dark adaptation, it looks like you could walk along that surface into the darkness and fall into nothing. There's absolutely nothing there. Perhaps when we are some - a little better dark adapted, you see Earth - features in earthshine, but we can't right now.</div>
<div><b>083:51:20 Haise:</b> Roger, Ed. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:51:47 Roosa:</b> Hey, Fredo, we sure picked a clear day to arrive; there's not much haze in the air at all. We can see all the way to the horizon.</div>
<div><b>083:51:56 Haise:</b> Incredible. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>083:52:47 Mitchell:</b> I guess we better make the boss happy and get on with the chow. [Garbled] knock off our descriptions at this point.</div>
<div><b>083:52:57 Haise:</b> Okay, Ed, you'll get another chance to look at it a couple of Revs later, a little lower.</div>
<div><b>083:53:08 Mitchell:</b> Roger. There sure is a lot to see. You could spend a lot of time talking about it.

<div class="onboard"><b>084:25:59 Shepard (onboard):</b> [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:26:01 Mitchell (onboard):</b> ... before the [Garbled] and we need to make this waste water dump on the backside. [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:26:25 Mitchell (onboard):</b> I'd like (cough) - Let's see what our waste water tank shows. We've got 60 percent. Man, that's [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:26:38 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:26:41 Roosa (onboard):</b> Well, I'm not going to do the sightings until just before the terminator - on the other side. We got the whole frontside pass, and we do want the - they wouldn't want any dump - dumping across the frontside, I don't think [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:26:52 Mitchell (onboard):</b> No. No. Definitely not.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:27:10 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Well, they should keep their schedule on the backside, too.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:27:35 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:27:54 Roosa (onboard):</b> No - No, I - I'm making a fast pass on the garbage can, but a little high in trajectory.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:29:25 Mitchell (onboard):</b> We [Garbled] the pass [Garbled] the backside pass after this one.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:29:34 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:29:42 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay. [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:29:57 Roosa (onboard):</b> No, what this is, is - we'll maneuver - we won't - Yes. We won't be torquing the vehicle to waste gas. This will just be a look at our landmark for a similar-type approach for tracking after Sep tomorrow, for the landing, and from the low altitude. Give me a hack at acquisition time. Even though on the actual tracking, you torque your spacecraft at 2 degrees per second. [Garbled] will become a problem. Okay. Here's the Hycon for the top - topo.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:30:42 Shepard (onboard):</b> Right on Descartes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:30:53 Shepard (onboard):</b> If you leave it up [Garbled] Descartes again, huh? Wait a minute.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:30:59 Roosa (onboard):</b> No. You go to sleep after that one.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:31:02 Shepard (onboard):</b> How are you supposed to configure the camera here? Okay. Your trigger's here and you actually photograph it there. And - [Garbled] eat and go to sleep. You [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:31:35 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes. That's [Garbled] while we're waiting.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>084:31:44 Mitchell (onboard):</b> I just want to see the [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:31:46 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:31:47 Roosa (onboard):</b> About 100 hours, we wake up. Somewhere in that time frame.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:31:51 Mitchell (onboard):</b> See what Stu's doing. See what kind of conflict we're really going to have in - getting dressed and that sort of thing.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:31:57 Shepard (onboard):</b> We actually - rest period officially ends at 99:30. The eat period - [Garbled] 20 [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:32:27 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Just a minute.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:32:30 Shepard (onboard):</b> That was a bit vague at that point.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:32:32 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:32:45 Shepard (onboard):</b> And we got the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> transmitter lights [Garbled] out.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:33:02 Shepard (onboard):</b> <a href="acron.html#p00">P00</a> update. And - right here might give you some trouble. [Garbled] power [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:33:16 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Roger. Getting into [Garbled] now. Tried to look for -</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:33:36 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay. Let's see.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:33:50 Shepard (onboard):</b> 101:50 [Garbled] in the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:33:56 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Time we start activation, huh? 101:50. That's 16 hours from now. Not very long.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:34:28 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yaw is [Garbled] ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:34:29 Mitchell (onboard):</b> [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:34:30 Shepard (onboard):</b> Pitch - pitch is supposed to be out, and yaw is supposed to be in. [Garbled] start [Garbled] Get those babies all hooked up. [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:35:05 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Al, what you looking for? Okay. They're all - all of those are in the flight data bag. These are on the suits.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:35:22 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes. We can't talk it over now, because we're going to have get [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:35:25 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Okay. Everything's off.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:35:28 Roosa (onboard):</b> [Garbled] Okay. <a href="acron.html#cmc">CMC</a>, Free and then Auto on the Verb 48. You got the purge line heaters on?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:35:41 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:35:45 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay, <a href="acron.html#cmc">CMC</a>, Free - that's Auto.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:35:53 Mitchell (onboard):</b> [Garbled] and I got 15 minutes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:35:56 Shepard (onboard):</b> [Garbled] 3, Verb 4 [Garbled] ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:35:57 Mitchell (onboard):</b> [Garbled] Myrtle here.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:02 Shepard (onboard):</b> We still want to do a B/D roll, won't we?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:05 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes, might as well.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:07 Shepard (onboard):</b> I'm going to load 2110. Okay?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:14 Roosa (onboard):</b> Before you - Hold it just a second before you Enter. Let me do that one more time, just to make sure we didn't get out of - Okay. Now enter it. Okay.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:27 Shepard (onboard):</b> What did you do that for?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:29 Roosa (onboard):</b> Well, see, we're in a 5-degree dead band.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:30 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:32 Roosa (onboard):</b> If you change that - if you change that to a narrow dead band, it will immediately fire and bring you over to the center of that 5-degree dead band. What cycling this to Free and Auto does is - it centers the dead band.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:44 Shepard (onboard):</b> I already did it once before I called up the 43 [Garbled] ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:46 Roosa (onboard):</b> Well, I was noticing the roll - the drift up. See, you're going to a - a half a degree dead band ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:51 Shepard (onboard):</b> [Garbled] drifted off.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:53 Roosa (onboard):</b> ... so, anything - more than a half a degree will cause a jet to fire.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:56 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes, okay. It was off half a degree?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:36:59 Roosa (onboard):</b> Well, you know, what - what's a half a degree. It was off a little bit.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:37:03 Shepard (onboard):</b> The att - it was actually rolling apparently.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:37:07 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes, we're - you know, we're - we were drifting in a 5-degree dead band. It's just that I'm real - See, we just had a firing there. Yes, after we sat there and talked about it. It's - it's the Pro on that 21101. Son of a gun. See, we just wasted some gas. We were talking about it.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:37:36 Shepard (onboard):</b> We were talking [Garbled] ?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:37:39 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes. But see, if you're moving, you've established it at that point. But then, if you're drifting along - and I should have remembered that, as many times as I've [Garbled] watched that. Anyway, you Enter; and then when you Pro on - on the 21101, what you're doing is, you're shrinking your phase plane now to a half a degree dead band. But you don't change the center.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:09 Shepard (onboard):</b> You change your center by going to Free ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:10 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:11 Shepard (onboard):</b> ... and back to Auto.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:14 Roosa (onboard):</b> See, we had already drifted out, because we got the firing.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:16 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes. Okay. Well, we should have ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:18 Roosa (onboard):</b> Just before we PROed ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:19 Shepard (onboard):</b> Just before you PROed ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:20 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:21 Shepard (onboard):</b> ... not - not just before you Enter.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:23 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:24 Shepard (onboard):</b> You had the right idea, but you did it the wrong way.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:26 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes. Kind of.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:29 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay. We're supposed to start the landmark tracking [Garbled] here.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:41 Roosa (onboard):</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:42 Shepard (onboard):</b> You can do that now [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:44 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:52 Shepard (onboard):</b> Plus zero. [Garbled] if we load it that way?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:38:57 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes, it should. Let's try it.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:39:12 Shepard (onboard):</b> How about that.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:39:17 Roosa (onboard):</b> Okay, we're <a href="acron.html#cmc">CMC</a>: Auto.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:39:19 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Do you want to use Myrtle, Al?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:39:21 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes; Just a second, Ed.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:39:24 Roosa (onboard):</b> Ready to go?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:39:30 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes, I'll - I'll flush the water, Ed. I'11 be right down there.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:39:34 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:39:40 Shepard (onboard):</b> And you can start the hydrogen and oxygen purge at 5 0. That's 10 minutes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:39:47 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:39:49 Shepard (onboard):</b> And the waste water dump.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:39:55 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Okay. Get [Garbled] going.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:39:57 Shepard (onboard):</b> Do you want to use Myrtle, also?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:40:00 Roosa (onboard):</b> While it's in here, thank you. I don't really need - no, I don't really need - no, I don't need to. It's going to be awhile before I really get a chance to again. No, I talked myself out of it.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:40:11 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay (laughter).</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:40:13 Roosa (onboard):</b> You know, it wouldn't hurt us to get that waste water dump started.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:40:16 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes. [Garbled] do it in a minute.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:40:18 Roosa (onboard):</b> [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:40:19 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes. I think [Garbled] be sure it's all out of the way, so it doesn't screw up your -</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:40:23 Roosa (onboard):</b> Did you turn the heaters on any earlier, or did you turn them on right at 30?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:40:27 Mitchell (onboard):</b> What, the hydrogen?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:40:29 Roosa (onboard):</b> No - yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:40:31 Mitchell (onboard):</b> No ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:40:32 Shepard (onboard):</b> Turned them on 3 minutes early.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:40:33 Roosa (onboard):</b> Okay. So we'll wait on that. But -</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:40:49 Mitchell (onboard):</b> This damn thing is [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:42:08 Roosa (onboard):</b> Isn't that something? We - we got so shocked by looking up and seeing the Moon in the window, we didn't do a Verb 82 (laughter).</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:42:17 Mitchell (onboard):</b> [Garbled] have any doubts?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:42:19 Roosa (onboard):</b> No, not after a residual like that.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:42:24 Shepard (onboard):</b> No, everything was as advertised all the way down.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:42:39 Shepard (onboard):</b> As advertised all the way down. Okay [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:42:51 Roosa (onboard):</b> No. Yes, my answer is no. Okay, what time is it? 42? Hell, let's get that water dump going. You ready, Ed?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:43:01 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes, I'm ready.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:43:04 Roosa (onboard):</b> You ready for the valves?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:43:06 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Let her rip.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:43:22 Roosa (onboard):</b> Okay. You want Dump A?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:43:25 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Let me have it.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:43:27 Roosa (onboard):</b> Okay. Ready, go. Cross off A.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:43:35 Mitchell (onboard):</b> And there's sunup.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:43:45 Roosa (onboard):</b> When is <a href="acron.html#aos">AOS</a> this Rev? Did they give us a map ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:43:49 Mitchell (onboard):</b> They didn't. They ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:43:50 Roosa (onboard):</b> I guess they ran out of time.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:43:52 Mitchell (onboard):</b> ... let us get behind [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:43:53 Shepard (onboard):</b> They gave us a map update, but they only gave it to us on the 180 degrees.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:43:59 Mitchell (onboard):</b> We could extrapolate from the [Garbled] ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:44:00 Roosa (onboard):</b> Oh, well - yes, the - at least as my - far as my Solo Book goes, the <a href="acron.html#aos">AOS</a>/<a href="acron.html#los">LOS</a> was in a minute of - shown in the - on my Solo Book.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:44:09 Mitchell (onboard):</b> [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:44:10 Roosa (onboard):</b> All they do is read me the 180 time. So that's probably what they were doing here. In fact, I may have said that. If anybody would say that I said that, I would agree with them. [Garbled] not anywhere around the points of the Moon, are they?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:44:37 Mitchell (onboard):</b> No [Garbled] can say what way we're pointing.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:44:40 Shepard (onboard):</b> We'll be up in the air, because the optics will be pointed down.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:44:44 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:44:45 Roosa (onboard):</b> Man, let me see. I need to see the what maps? Oh, you put them - Yes ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>084:44:54 Mitchell (onboard):</b> I put up there.</div>

Since this burn is done behind the Moon, <a href="acron.html#fido">FIDO</a> and his backroom specialists will have to wait until the spacecraft reappears before they can look at the burn data and obtain new tracking data.  They will then have only 12 minutes to make sure that the burn went as planned and that the spacecraft will not descend too low. Just in case, as soon as they finish the <a href="acron.html#doi">DOI</a> burn, they will set the spacecraft up for a bailout burn.  If it appears that they would be descending too low, they could then do the bailout burn to immediately stop their descent.</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control, Houston at 86 hours ground elapsed time. Apollo 14 now on it's second revolution around the moon. For the descent orbit insertion burn the onboard computer program 40 will be used as this is the service propulsion system thrust program. We expect to see 14 - the crew of 14 start into that program sequence and maneuver to burn attitude before they pass out of range on this revolution. The burn, of course, will be done at 86 hours 50 minutes 54 seconds when the spacecraft is out of contact with Mission Control. At time of ignition minus 30 seconds the onboard computer starts counting down to the burn at TIG minus 5 seconds the proceed button must be pushed probably by spacecraft commander Al Shepard for the countdown to continue. Otherwise, the maneuver will not be accomplished. We're at 86 hours 2 minutes ground elapsed time. We show our Mission Control clock at - we're 48 minutes 48 seconds from time of ignition.

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control Houston. We've had Loss of Signal with Apollo 14 as it - now passing over the back side of the Moon. On this pass the descent orbit insertion burn will be performed near perilune. The command service module <a href="acron.html#doi">DOI</a> burn is performed with the service propulsion system engine and this with the spacecraft at an essentially retrograde attitude and the crew heads down. Following the <a href="acron.html#doi">DOI</a> burn the vehicle is maneuvered to the required attitude for a possible preplanned contingency burn called the bail out burn. Initial burn attitude is such that the vehicle is pitched up some 73 degrees above the local horizontal. At the bail out burn time - the bail out burn time, this is at acquisition of signal plus 12 minutes. Assuming the likelihood that the bail out burn will not be required, the command and service module is maneuvered to an attitude which allows the visual observation of landmark, H3, with the optics. As you would expect, the bail out burn is one case where the mission control centers fondest hope is to get no go for the maneuver. We're at 86 hours 31 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control Houston."</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>087:00:19 Shepard (onboard):</b> We lost it.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>087:01:04 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Put that in there.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:01:07 Roosa (onboard):</b> Thank you.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>087:01:46 Roosa (onboard):</b> See the bright crater right on the edge of Chaplygin there, too? Through my window maybe. See it coming right there? That thing really shows up.

<div class="onboard"><b>087:02:10 Shepard (onboard):</b> It's a hell of a view. It's coming zipping around, you know how you do - Just like [Garbled.]</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>087:02:41 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Should be 21 minutes after - 20 sec - 20 minutes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:03:05 Unknown crew member (onboard):</b> [Garbled.]</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>087:04:10 Shepard (onboard):</b> What?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:04:11 Mitchell (onboard):</b> We're losing our view. We should be coming up on the Crater Mendeleev.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:04:17 Shepard (onboard):</b> [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:04:19 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Pardon? Do you have Mendeleev out your side, Stu?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:04:25 Roosa (onboard):</b> No, it's off to your - to your right.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:04:27 Mitchell (onboard):</b> That's right, you couldn't - We're too low for you to be able to see across. You have - you should be about over Chaplygin.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:04:33 Roosa (onboard):</b> We're past Chaplygin - we're going right over the Lovelett.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:04:36 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Are you?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:04:41 Shepard (onboard):</b> Look at that.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:04:42 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:04:45 Shepard (onboard):</b> Isn't that wild?</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>087:05:12 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:05:24 Shepard (onboard):</b> You get more of a feeling of the elevation from the [Garbled] here.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:05:27 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes. Could I crowd you over just a hair, so I can look out your window?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:05:31 Shepard (onboard):</b></div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:05:32 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Oh. Yes. We're losing all of it now, aren't we?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:05:59 Roosa (onboard):</b> You know, that - that sharp crater back at Chaplygin was rather phenomenal. Next time we come across there, if you get a chance to see it - it looks like it's been draped around the rim.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:06:09 Shepard (onboard):</b> Draped?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:06:10 Roosa (onboard):</b> With a - with a darker material. Kind of - It's real fascinating.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:06:25 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Well, it is pitch black out this window. I can see stars out this window.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:06:32 Shepard (onboard):</b> That's good.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:06:33 Mitchell (onboard):</b> I'll be darned.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:06:45 Mitchell (onboard):</b> I can see your jets firing, too.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:06:47 Shepard (onboard):</b> It really must be nice [Garbled] Yes. We're there.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:06:55 Mitchell (onboard):</b> We were there, huh?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:06:59 Shepard (onboard):</b> Roger. We are there. Okay, Imbrium.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:07:03 Roosa (onboard):</b> Oh, that's right.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:07:06 Shepard (onboard):</b> [Garbled] happy over there?</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>087:07:12 Shepard (onboard):</b> Three.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:07:13 Roosa (onboard):</b> Oh, 63; okay, yes; it's there. It - it'll go ahead and die down - once it's [Garbled] 58 feet.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:07:53 Shepard (onboard):</b> The scheduled acquisition is at 16:08 [Garbled] maybe get a couple of things going.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:08:00 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:08:04 Shepard (onboard):</b> [Garbled.]</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:08:05 Mitchell (onboard):</b> We're higher. We ought to get there ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:08:06 Shepard (onboard):</b> We're a little higher.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:08:07 Mitchell (onboard):</b> ... a little early.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:08:08 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes, we're higher, even though we're slower; we'll probably be a little early.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:08:17 Mitchell (onboard):</b> What are you coming up on, Stu? Okay. You - you're coming up on 11:20.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:08:31 Roosa (onboard):</b> We ought to be able to see [Garbled] out there. We're just about north of it. You know, it's not as dark - the mare's not as dark as I expected it to be.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:08:41 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Okay. It's sure darker than I expected it to be. Noticeably darker. I really didn't expect it to be that - at this altitude or this close - expect to be able to see that much difference.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:09:29 Mitchell (onboard):</b> I'm going to see that I'm all set up for this acquisition. Minus 39; plus 325. Okay. I'm High Gain, Manual, Wide. And 6 minutes away from it.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:09:56 Shepard (onboard):</b> Oh, it looks good through the sextant.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:09:59 Roosa (onboard):</b> what?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:10:01 Shepard (onboard):</b> Sure looks good through the sextant.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:10:06 Roosa (onboard):</b> Well, I think it's got a reddish tint to it out the window. Sort of like, you know, the southwest desert. You know, red hasn't been mentioned before. Do you see Tsiolkovsky over there?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:10:26 Mitchell (onboard):</b> Oh, sure; that's Tsiolkovsky. Okay. I've got it. Yes. That mother is black out there, isn't it? And flat. And there are really a lot more color differences than I expected.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:10:49 Shepard (onboard):</b> Okay. What's that one that we talked about the other time that had that bench - the bench that looked like a quarry.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:10:57 Roosa (onboard):</b> Oh, the bright one.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:10:58 Shepard (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:10:59 Roosa (onboard):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:11:00 Shepard (onboard):</b> It's got a reddish tint to it. Got a lot of boulders in it, too. That's a really sharp drop in the - in the walls of that baby - really sharp break.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>087:11:24 Roosa (onboard):</b> Okay. Langemak is coming up on this side ...</div>

<div><b>087:52:26 Fullerton:</b> Roger.</div>
<div><b>087:52:27 Roosa:</b> Okay, Gordon. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>087:52:29 Fullerton:</b> Loud and clear, Stu.</div>
<div><b>087:52:33 Roosa:</b> Okay. Well, that turned out to be a piece of cake. At a very low angle, Ed, located by coming off of points B and BA and about 51:05 or 51:10 on this clock, the elevation angle was enough that I could pick up Main Street. And, just for your info, using high speed, I could track it just smooth as glass all the way through even though we're in inertial attitude. And, it looks relatively easy. I think 14-2 ought to really be a piece of cake. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>087:53:14 Fullerton:</b> Roger; sounds good. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>087:53:36 Roosa:</b> Gordon - the optics, even at this low altitude, tracking the landmarks is rather phenomenal. You can just keep it right on there at high speed, just as smooth.</div>
<div><b>087:53:52 Fullerton:</b> Roger, Stu. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>087:54:12 Fullerton:</b> Stu, Ron is with me here. He was curious about how good the initial pointing accuracy of the optics is. Over.</div>
<div><b>087:54:24 Roosa:</b> Okay. Well, it - I think it was right on the money. When they first came up, it was pretty bright, and the background release on H-3, that ridge right behind it, did not show up out in the flat surface as much as I would have hoped. And, of course, I've got the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>
there, too. I couldn't pick it up until the trunnion got down to about 31 or 32 degrees. The optics were right in the area. I think they were a little high. But, I came off, like I say, off of Mosting B and BA, and got - I picked it up at a fairly low elevation, I believe. And, then as soon as we came upon them a little bit, why we're right there. And, then I - then I tracked them with the high speed and I never gave it back to the <a href="acron.html#cmc">CMC</a>. [Long pause]</div>

<div><b>087:58:15 Roosa:</b> Okay, Gordon. Even without being dark adapted, just coming off with my eye glued on the optics coming across the Sun, you can see a very definite horizon through the optics here in earthshine. And - can pick out the - the rims of the - of the bright - bright craters and craters that do have bright rims on them. And - I'm sure if you were really dark adapted you could see quite a bit through the optics scanners. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>087:58:54 Fullerton:</b> Roger, Stu. That's - that's interesting. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>087:59:09 Shepard:</b> Of course, with the naked eye, you can see excellent horizon and earthshine. I'm looking, for example, to the south at the moment and have a very clear horizon in that direction.</div>
<div><b>087:59:20 Fullerton:</b> Roger, Al. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>087:59:33 Mitchell:</b> And, Houston, looking to the north, we see the same view. It's a very sharply defined horizon. I can see the stars.

<div><b>089:41:40 Roosa:</b> All right, Gordon. We took them, changed the - the ranges by the time - times listed in your call, but there was some strange noises coming out of the - the magazine. Both - both spools worked, and the frame counter ran, and the FMC worked. But there was sort of a clacking noise on the - in the magazine. It came on between frames 140 and 180, then went back to the Normal Mode, and then started again at frame 240, and went until the end of the film pass. And I'm reading 420 on the counter, was reading 5 when I started. I used five for the checkout. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>089:42:29 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Stu. There was - was no change in operation when the - It looked like it was taking the pictures okay, just the funny noises. Is that all?</div>
<div><b>089:42:43 Roosa:</b> Yes. It - it - it did - it did look like it was going all right. Like I say, the film wound up, and the FMC continued to work. However, when I went to Standby at the end, the FMC kept trying to drive. And, now the Mode switch in Standby, and I turned the power on. Instead of just getting the one flap over to the side, we'll have the FMC like you do normally, it wants to keep driving. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>089:43:14 Fullerton:</b> Okay. Before you fold it up ...</div>
<div><b>089:43:16 Roosa:</b> No, belay that, Gordon - Hey, belay that, Gordon. It doesn't - FMC does not keep driving, but that noise is - is still in there. May - maybe you can hear it here. I'll - I'll hold the mike down (machinegun-like noise). Okay. I don't know if you can get anything out of that or not, but that's with the sta - Mode switch in Standby and the power On. And, during that period of time, the FMC kicked a couple of times. It initially went off to the side like it does when you apply the power. And then, during that period of time that I had the transmitter down, the FMC did work twice with the Mode switch in Standby and power switch On. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>089:44:08 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Stu, before you fold it all up, if it doesn't get in the way there, why don't you let me check with the back room and see if there's anything they want you to - else they want you to look at there, and I'll get back with you.</div>

<div><b>089:57:18 Roosa:</b> Well, to answer your questions, no, there was no sounds like this. I have never heard this on any training camera. It was not on the checkout during translunar coast. It was not on this camera - I mean on this magazine during the checkout. It did not start until approximately frame 140. It stopped at frame 180, and went back to what appeared normal.

The frame counter moved, and the - that both the feed, and the take-up spools were turning. And, if it's any problem, it would have been, I suspect, in the FMC. Well now, that shouldn't have been in there. It's got to be in the magazine. I don't really know. I'm going to let you all worry about that one, I guess.

<div><b>090:02:38 Fullerton:</b> Okay. Talked to Dale Denais. He thinks its most likely something wrong in the magazine there. And, it could either be a gear train or a clutch in there that could be making and breaking. He suggests that you get out a magazine Victor once again and put it on there and leave it in Standby awhile to verify that it doesn't cycle - or - or the FMC doesn't sweep. And, if that looks okay, then go ahead and run off two or three frames and see if it appears normal. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>090:03:26 Roosa:</b> Okay. I need to put that one on anyway. I'll put on magazine V, and I'll turn the power on and put it in Standby and see how it acts, and then run off two or three frames. And, along that line, this magazine, you know, was in Standby for a minute there - you know with the power on prior to start, and we got no noises. And I agree with diagnosis there. It - I'm sure it's in the magazine, or relatively sure. It sounded like it; felt like it. And, it did feel like something like a clutch slipping on the thing. [Long pause]</div>

<div class="pao">Apollo Control Houston, 91 hours 02 minutes <a href="acron.html#get">GET</a> time for the flight of Apollo 14. We show we're 10 seconds away from time of acquisition of the spacecraft. We'll stand by."</div>
<div class="pao">We are now receiving data."</div>
<div><b>091:03:02 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 14, Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>091:03:08 Roosa:</b> Go ahead, Houston; 14.</div>
<div><b>091:03:10 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Stu, you're loud and clear. That early <a href="acron.html#aos">AOS</a> on the last Rev was our mistake. We were misled by a misset clock here in the control room. How did the <a href="acron.html#ltc">LTC</a> look to you after you tried the new magazine?</div>
<div><b>091:03:30 Roosa:</b> Well, I tell you what; we ended up with the same trouble; let me - let me run through and tell you you what it is. Let me get the flight plan out here.</div>
<div><b>091:03:39 Fullerton:</b> Okay.</div>
<div><b>091:03:44 Roosa:</b> Okay, I put Mag B on the camera, and I ran it in Standby for about 2 and a half minutes, and everything worked fine. I then went - shot three frames at about - with the intervalometer set on 10, and it worked fine. And then, I thought, well, maybe it's the fast-frame rate; so, I put it on 65 and shot off five or six, and it worked okay. Then, I went to Standby and then on to Single-Frame and punched the single frame and got the same noise. And then, it started - the magazine started actuating in - in Standby with the power on. So, I turned the power off, ran the intervalometer back down to 10, turned the power back on; still had the noise. And the magazine appears to follow the intervalometer setting, but it may do this on a random fashion while in Standby. And it does move the film, or at least the - both spools move and the counter moves. And it had that same clacking sound - not really a clacking sound, but I guess it's kind of hard to describe; maybe that's as good a term as any. And so, I turned the magazine off. By this time, I had shot 20 - 20 frames - 23 frames and decided that was enough film to waste. I really didn't mean to use that many, but I was trying to check out that 65-per-minute intervalometer setting. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>091:05:36 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Stu, that's a good summary of what you did. Personally, I more mystified than before. And we'll let them work on that some more.</div>
<div><b>091:05:49 Roosa:</b> Okay, I guess, in summary, we got the same problem with both magazines. Now - maybe the film is working all right; maybe we are just getting - getting a strange noise in there on the gears or the clutch as you suggested. But we've ended up now with both magazines having the same symptom.</div>
<div><b>091:06:13 Fullerton:</b> Roger, understand. We'll think about it while you are sleeping, I guess, and maybe have some fresh ideas in the morning. For your general information, the - Your pericynthion was slightly high, but it seems to be coming down faster than we anticipated it would with each Rev; with the result that at <a href="acron.html#pdi">PDI</a> time, you ought to be right on the money, as near as we can tell. So it's pretty good work on that point. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>091:06:54 Roosa:</b> Okay, that sounds real good; I guess I - I was a little surprised at the 0.6 residual from the <a href="acron.html#gn">G&N</a>. You know, the impulse burn was a little lower than that, but I guess somebody - it doesn't bother anybody. And, yes, it looked like a real great burn to us, and it sounds like good news about being right there for <a href="acron.html#pdi">PDI</a>.</div>
<div><b>091:07:19 Fullerton:</b> Okay, and one thing for Ed: his biosensor seems to be acting up. We'd like him at his convenience, some time before suiting up tomorrow, to go through the same sort of checkout that Al did earlier in the flight on his sensors. Over. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>091:07:42 Roosa:</b> Okay, I'll pass that on to Ed.</div>
<div><b>091:07:47 Fullerton:</b> Okay, that's all I have on my list at the moment. Over.</div>
<div><b>091:07:57 Roosa:</b> Okay, I guess we've got nothing else here. We're going to try to get secured for the big day tomorrow, and we'll be seeing you in the morning.</div>
<div><b>091:08:07 Fullerton:</b> Okay, I'll make one check to make sure we haven't got anything else before we shut up and let you get some sleep.</div>
<div><b>091:08:17 Roosa:</b> Okay. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>091:08:33 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Stu. One - one other thing. We did get that E - E - E-MOD before we went <a href="acron.html#aos">AOS</a>, okay; and, I guess - Wait I just think there - there is one thing. Just stand by. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>091:08:52 Fullerton:</b> Okay, we would like you to turn the optics off tonight. That should do it. Get a good rest there. Over.</div>
<div><b>091:09:02 Roosa:</b> Roger; we'll get the optics off before we go to sleep, and we've been doing that. And yes, I guess, if you've got any other questions on that - on the Hycon, I'd entertain them now to help you with the troubleshooting, but that's about it. We'll see you tomorrow.</div>
<div><b>091:09:21 Fullerton:</b> Okay, good night.
