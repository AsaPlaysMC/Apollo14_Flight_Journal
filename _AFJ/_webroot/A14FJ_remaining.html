Step 3: reset control box film counter to zero; shutter speed to l/200th of a second; with magazine removed, visually examine the shutter-curtain slit position. If the slit is visible, it should not be more than 1 inch from the magazine guide rail. Examine sprocket area for visible tears. Step 4: install magazine Whiskey and actuate single frame. Remove magazine and verify slit is not more than 1 inch from magazine guide rail, if visible. Thirty seconds to LOS. I repeat, switch from nonessential power from BUS B to A or A to B, opposite what you had. Reset control box film counter to zero and shutter to l/200th; with magazine removed, visually examine shutter-curtain slit position; if visible, slit should not be more than 1 inch frcm magazine guide rail.

Our feeling right now is that this is a single-cell problem in ascent battery number 5- If one cell were shorted out entirely and completely discharged, this would drop your terminal voltage by 1.8 volts. The expected voltage, open circuit, at activation is greater than 35-3. I say again, it's greater than 35*3. However, the open circuit voltage will not be our criterion. We will use the Delta in voltage between BATs 5 and 6 underload to evaluate battery 5. If there is more than a 1.8-volt Delta between 5 and 6 - that is, if it should turn out that you have a problem with more than one cell, then battery 5 will be NO GO. Over.</span>

By way of general discussion, evidently by recreating the noise here on the ground, the only way that we can recreate the noise is by causing a DC power current limit problem to the camera. An indication on board there that this is - that would really verify that it's a DC power problem would be a flickering power-on light while - while you're getting that clacking sound. But, any rate, the consensus here is that, when the camera is making the clacking sound, you're not getting good pictures. I believe you got the - about five steps about checking the panel 227 cable, and for pin damage, and reconnecting and switching the NONESSENTIAL BUS to MAIN A. Is that correct?

However, if you have time to verify that it's not a camera shutter being out of sequence - out of synchronization, you could shut the shutter to l/200th, and remove the magazine, and visually examine the shutter curtain inside to see that the slit in the shutter curtain is within 1 inch from one of the side rails, either side. And, at that time, examine the sprocket area from visible tears in the shutter curtain sprocket holes. After checking, if it is on one side, reinstall the magazine - and use magazine W for this - and actuate one single frame, and remove the magazine, and check that the slit is still positioned over to the side. If the slit is remaining in the center, then the camera shutter is completely out of SYNC and the camera is essentially unusable. Is that clear? Over.</span>

Hey, that LTC camera's still acting up the same way; I tried both nonessential BUS positions, and I cycled all the connectors - could see no visi - visible damage to the pins. I did look at that slit in the shutter, and the first two times I actuated it, it stayed pretty much over 1 inch from the edge. And then, the next couple of times, it stopped about 2 inches from the edge -one each time a different edge, but out about 2 inches, maybe just a little more. It still has the clacking sound; it still wants to - intermittently fire off a frame in standby, even with the frames per minute set on zero. And I did not take the LTC photo target 16; I figured that Gordon had LMPlied that it might be a waste of film to shoot them this way; I thought maybe we could get it fixed, we could save the film. I did shoot the landing because I figured, even if it is working - that one we wouldn't have another chance at. And I fired 39 frames off of magazine B on the landing per the pad. I don't know whether it will turn out or not, because it - it clanked and fluttered the whole time.</span>

And once you apply the power, it - it goes into its MAG and does its thing there, regardless of whether you have the MODE switch in AUTO, STANDBY, or SINGLE, and whether or not you turn the POWER ON and OFF again. Generally: now, when I came up to shoot the landing, when I turned the POWER switch ON a minute before the T start, it clanked all the time but didn't fire off any frames. And during the - minute plus a few seconds path there, it just kicked one, going off as it should every -one every 2 seconds.

    <span class="words">Okay. First of all, let's say that REVs 25 and 26 are going to be nominal, no matter - as far as you're concerned - no matter what other activities people decide to juggle around. And, in case you didn't get the word, the President called Control Center, here awhile back, and offered us his congratulations to all of you, and the team down here for doing a good job; and as soon as we get a transcript of that, why, we'll read it up to you. The third thing is that Hycon camera. We've been talking to the Hycon people; and they're of the opinion that many of the things we've been chasing, some of the shutter oscillations and so forth, would not occur if the - or could not occur - if the counter is, in fact, counting off with each film advance; and it's our LMPression that, normally, you've been seeing the film counter advance. So, we've got a couple of steps we'd like to have you try in order to verify camera operation. The betting is that we have a good chance that the camera is functioning normally as far as taking pictures, and the noise may or may not be extraneous. The first question is status of MAG W. And if it still has some film on it, we'd like you to use it as the one to perform the check I'm going to describe to you.</span>

And we'll do this by looking down the lens barrel, looking from the - the operating end back towards the shutter. And what you're going to be seeing is -you won't see the shutter slit go across, but you will see the motion; and you should be able to detect the direction of motion, and the time of it. And you may want to use your flashlight to look down into the lens barrel and see what a - what you're doing. I'll read you some details - a detailed procedure; I just want to give you an outline first of what we're doing.</span>

I understand that they're satisfied with what you saw, and they think that - that looks normal, which is one of the things that makes us think that the camera is probably operating normally. And if it turns out that the shutter is oscillating, what you're going to see is just a blur; but, again, you'll see a - the - the blur will appear to oscillate; and I think you'll be able to detect that the shutter is going from side to side; and it just looks like a big flash. And I - if you'll put the - put a flashlight in the lens with you as you look in there, I think you'll be able to see it; and you may even see one of the seams on the Mylar, when it comes to a stop. So, with that description of what it is you're going to be looking at, I'll read you the detailed procedures, if. you're ready.</span>

Go ahead and put the camera on the couch, or wherever it's convenient for you, with the lens opening visible to you. And you might want to tie the camera down, because we're going to operate it. Go ahead and hook up the camera according to the instruction decal; do everything in the normal orders. Like to have you make the following settings: for the MODE, we'd like to use AUTO; the shutter should be on l/50th of a second; the RANGE, 99-9; and the FRAME RATE at 60. Once you have the control box set up, turn the power to ON; and we'd like to have you observe the shutter operation by looking through the lens and use the penlight. And go ahead and run this thing, say 10 cycles. Like to have you also verify that the magazine sP00ls are rotating and that the counter is counting for each actuation that you observe.</span>

What we'd like for you to do is - do this little test at your convenience, and let us know what you see. If it works out that this is one of these times where the test is performed, and the camera sounds like it's operating okay, go ahead and run the test; but don't sit there and run the camera trying to make it duplicate the sounds you've heard before. And what we're going to do is assume that if you see a shutter move, and it sounds right - we're going to assume that it's okay. Now - then, later in the flight, if this thing starts to act up again, we'd like to have you go ahead and finish that pass using the film; assume again that it's working properly; but, at the first convenient time afterwards, perform this test again. And the time, of course, that we're most interested in is performing this test when the noises and so forth are coming out.</span>

We've been able to duplicate your noises down here by setting up an oscillation in the slit, whereas the shutter just sits there and runs back and forth. And it's cycling. Just completely out of control. So, we want to verify that that's not our problem. In that case, if you look at the slit before and after an actuation, you would find that the slit had moved, but it wouldn't tell you that it was moving properly. And I think that's the big thing you're looking for.</span>

We've been able to lower the power into the camera and make it do that. And it'll sit there; and, when the timing logic gets out of sequence, then there's - there's a little -all the timing internal to the camera is run from a commutator. And this little commutator can get hung up on one sequence like the shutter operation, and it?ll sit there and do that. The reason the EMC seems to operate normally is that that's all an AC operation, and the problems that we have been able to duplicate have all been associated with DC.</span>

So, we're going to hang our hats on this check that you're making just to - to verify that - our assumption that the camera's probably taking photographs and operated normally. If it turns out that the shutter speeds have been off or something of that nature, once we know that - and we can determine that on the ground - we can process the film accordingly and -and recover all of the data. And just as a backup procedure, we've had a lot of people working around the theory here that - to see what we can do - how we'd use our film if we finally have a limited amount or how we want to apportion our other film resources to take the place in case this camera check doesn't pass.</span>

Now if that's a completely - you know, if the shutter kind of oscillates, not with respect to the intervalometer setting; it may not be working correctly, and I guess I'm still not quite clear in my own mind that if the shutter's oscillating back and forth at the rate of the intervalometer setting.</span>

But, basically, it looks like it - Well, we're really not sure that it works or not, but we think it probably won't. But as a final check on it, if you get a chance, do the same procedures, as kind of before. Except, put your frame rate down to 10 frames per minute instead of 60. And, that'll be a slower operation there, and kind of observe, first of all, looking through the lens you should be able to see the shutter slit or at least a piece of tape-looking-like stuff, you know, where the shutter slit is; and kind of get an idea of what's happening to the shutter slit if you can. And, from what I understand, what you said before is that, it looks like it's zigging back and forth until the intervalometer hits - hits the thing, and then it kind of stops for a second or something, and then it starts zigging back and forth, again. Is that kind of correct?</span>

    <span class="words">Okay. As far as whether or not the shutter is oscillating or going in one direction, I can't tell. We did run out of film on this magazine W and that made it a little easier to see in there. With this shutter sticking like this, you're going to expose any film underneath it because, you know, it's moving at fast enough rate that I can see through and see the platen now. I can see the holes in the platen with the shutter oscillating. It goes fast. I'd say it's a couple of three times a second oscillation. Or at least that's the noise level, now. I'm not sure what the shutter's doing it's moving so fast. In AUTO and in single frame, when you push the button, the shutter does stop for just an instant, and just randomly, you will see the slit. Now it's not always there. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it isn't, sometimes It's a different width on the slit. Now, why don't we start there, and then I'll entertain the questions.</span>

We'll keep you posted. We owe you some detail procedures on probe stowage, which will be up later on today.

    <span class="words">Okay, Houston. What we'll try to do this afternoon is show you four of the experiments that we're carrying on board; and even though we'd like to think that maybe they're a major breakthrough -Essentially what these are, are experiments to check out not only the theory involved in the zero-g environment but also the technical problems that we may face in designing bigger and better experiments for Skylab. And three of these experiments deal primarily with convection or, in our case, lack of convection, we hope, during the zero-g. And now, for the purists out - of you in the audience that say we should be calling it zero g, we'll concede to that and go ahead and call it zero g anyway, just for clarification; and everybody knows what we are talking about. But, really, what we're talking about is a free-fall situation, or the lack of weight. So, of course, on Earth under a one-g field, when you heat something, air, so forth, why, we say air rises; and this is due the influence of gravity on the - on the air that becomes less dense; and the cold air comes underneath; and you have your convection patterns, which everyone is familiar with. Well, under our situation, we probably have a lack of, or we do have a lack of these convection patterns; and we're going to use this to show some experiments and, hopefully, how in later missions that we can manufacture products and, perhaps, medicines and so forth. And the first one of these is the heat flow - it's a heat-flow experiment that we've got mounted over here, if Ed will put the camera on it. And what we have here are various cells; and, maybe, A1 can point them out there on the radial zone. And inside each one of these zones, as - as outlined here, is a heat-sensitive material. And it will change colors as it's heated. And they'll not all change at the same time due to the substance that the sensor is made out of; however, these two are exactly the same. And, now, under a g-field, if you had - had these two the same and you heated them, well, of course, the hot air would rise. And let's say that you had this sitting on the table, the one above it you would see a - a marked difference in the heating pattern. Here, under our weightless condition, the pattern should be the same. In other words, in these two cells, the heating should go out evenly on both sides. Now, you will see a difference on - on these two because of the sensor being of different material. So, if A1 will throw on the switch - and we'll see some response from this. It'll take about a minute. And, while we?re waiting for that, we have essentially the same thing in a different form, across the top. And we can only heat one at a time; so, we'll heat up this radial zone, first - I think you'll have a better chance of seeing this. And maybe, we'll throw - heat this up and throw it on -put the TV camera on them later. And while - while that's heating up, I'd like to show you another one that - that we've got. Okay.</span>

    <span class="words">Okay. What we have are l8 of these small canisters, each one containing a different metal and/or a mixture. And the purpose of this experiment is to get some data on casting under our weightless or zero-g conditions. And here again, when you cast metals, you heat them; and when they cool, you have convection currents in them. Hopefully, here in our laboratory, we can heat these and cool them - They will have even cooling. And also, another part of this experiment is, some of the metals are mixed with fibers and/or various other particles. And the theory here, to increase the strength of the casting with these fibers. Now, on Earth, under a one-g field, this gets to be a rather difficult process because, during the cooling, the fibers settle out; and you don't get a homogeneous mix and a cooling; so, you don't have equal strength. So, what we do is, we heat these up and then we run through various processes. Some of them we shake; some of them we don't shake; and then, we cool them. We put them on a little heat sink, here. And we'll let it set and cool for a certain period of time; and then, we'll change it, put in another casting, and press ahead. There?s really not much else to show on - on TV with - with this one. It's - it takes quite a bit of time, by the time we run through all the castings; but we just park it up in the tunnel out of the way. And when our kitchen timer goes off, why, we'll either cool it or put in a new casting and press ahead. And I see the - getting some action on the convection experiment over here, on the radial experiment; and we'd be real curious, Gordon, if you can pick this up, if we've got enough light.</span>

    <span class="words">Okay, Gordon. And what we have here is an elect -electrophoresis experiment. And we're not - we're not going to run this one on the TV camera. It's a one-shot operation. But on the left side here, we're got three channels going across this beauty; and over on the left, in a chamber, we have three different compounds containing organic molecules. And what we're going to do is apply a voltage to each one of these chambers, and then, open up the partition between the chamber where the organic molecules are, and our channel going across. And the theory here being that as you charge the - the molecules, they will move out across this channel. Now, some molecules will take a better charge than the other ones, and they will move faster. Well, under a gravity field - here again, you have the convection currents; and it tends to mix up the molecules; the heavier molecules settle out to the bottom of the channel. They don't make it all the way across, and so forth. All the problems involved with the convection again. So here, hopefully, the only variable will be the different type of molecule. And we hope these molecules will then separate themselves in bunches - based on the assumption that all molecules of the same kind, you know - you know are all - been doing their physical conditioning and will run as the same rate. So, anyway, the molecules will move across and, hopefully, will separate them into bands. Now, we've got three different types of - of molecules here; and one, the sLMPlest one, it's just some red and blue dye. And this phenomena will take place under a gravity field, and this happens on the Earth. And we work up in numbers up to - to quite heavy molecules, and these are the ones that we cannot do on Earth. And we're trying to see if it's possible to - to do them here under zero-g; and there are quite a few ramifications to this, if it really comes off. And one of the most obvious is in the field of medicine, in making pure vaccines, and so forth. Now, we don't expect this - this experiment to solve the problems. We're trying to get a hack -see if the theory is correct and, also, to work out some of the engineering details, such as, when you heat - apply this voltage, you form a few gas bubbles around it, and so, we have to have a little pump that circulates the fluid at a very low rate. And we're wanting to see if this works and if it disrupts the travel of the molecules. So, this -this we hope is the first step toward bigger and better experiments and, eventually, a truly manufacturing process.</span>

    <span class="words">Okay, I guess that's about all of it from our zero-g lab of Apollo 14. I think - we're real pleased with the experiments, and I want to compliment all of the Pi's and the work that they did. They - they came out extremely well; they went just as advertised on the procedures, gave us no trouble, and it's been - they've been real enjoyable to work with. And, hopefully, this is the beginning of bigger and better things in the way of manufacturing processes and so forth, in space. And I believe A1 has got some words here.</span>

    <span class="words">I just wanted to say a couple of words before we signed off tonight. What we've been talking about among the three of us, as we been setting up these experiments, is the contribution this could make, immediately and directly, into American lives and to the lives of people around the world. For example, if, specifically, these manufacturing processes of metals turned out to be better in the space environment; or the vaccines, which are proposed to be developed in weightless condition, can be used effectively and immediately. And, certainly, this type of an operation in Skylabs of the future can become immediately beneficial to the peoples of the United States and the peoples of the World. As a matter of fact, one of the things we're talking about, in that connection, was the tremendous achievements of the space program, so far, that have contributed particularly in the field of communication. For example, right now, I'm sure this broadcast is going directly overseas to millions of people who are seeing it in their homes through satellite. And I think many people have said that this LMProvement in communication through the space satellite will certainly go a long way in solving the problems of the World -problems of understanding between peoples of different nations and different countries. We are reminded, however, as we look at that shimmering crescent tonight, which is the Earth, on our way back, that there still is fighting going on. The three of us all have acquaintances, friends, and even relatives in Viet Nam. We are reminded that some of the people - some of the men who have gone to Viet Nam - have not returned, that are still being held there, listed as missing in action or as prisoners of war. And it is our wish, tonight, that we can, in some way, contribute, through our efforts to the space program, to promote a better understanding of peace throughout the World and help to rectify these situations which still exist. And with that thought, for Ed and Stu and myself, I will say good night to you from Apollo 14.</span>

We'd just like to give it to you once through quickly so you can think about it, and we'll do it In detail tomorrow when we get around to doing it for real. The first thing is the stowage for the decontamination bags that ordinarily go on A-10 and A-13. We're going to modify that to stow the one that has 30 pounds in it, and put that one on A-13, using the existing tiedown rings. But the one that has 20 pounds, rather than putting it on A-10, we want to put it on A-8. And use the D-rings on A-8 in essentially the same manner - the normal manner of strapping it down. On top of that one, we want to take the CMP suit and helmet and put it in a sleeping bag, and then use the LM webbing and lash it down on top of the 20-pound decontamination bag on A-8. And this should all tie down there to allow a minimum 4-inch clearance to the couch for couch stroking. Are you with me so far?</span>

    <span class="words">Okay. Now for the probe stowage. We start by going through A-10. And remove anything you think you might need later. We can't identify anything in there that will be needed later, but you want to take a check, because once we get the probe lashed down on top of that - it will be pretty tough to get back in there. Then go to A-5 and remove the headrest pads and put them on the couches. Take the heel clips and ropes, there should be five ropes in there , and stow them temporarily. From the right-hand side of A-5, take the cushion and all the equipment that's in that cushion and put it in foodbox B-l. And from A-6, take the two LiOH cans from A-6 and put them in the left-hand side of A-5. So take the TV equipment that's in A-6, wrap the TV monitor in a constant wear garment, and put all the TV equipment into B-l, also. Okay. Now take the ropes -take one of the ropes that you removed from A-5 and double it, and then tie it to footpad on A-6 -the footpad that's in the corner. It'd be the plus-Y, plus-Z footpad on A-6. And take three other ropes and tie one end of each of those three ropes - we won?t double those ropes - tie one end of each of those three to the same point, that being the other footpad near the wall on A-6. It'd be the plus-Y, minus-Z footpad. Okay. Now we go to the probe and take two flight data file books and tape them to the base end of the probe, the end with the capture latch release handle. The probe now will be placed with one of the pitch arms - those are the large arms that - that normally contact the face of the drogue - one of those pitch arms down toward the aft bulkhead between A-6 and A-10. The apex of the probe pointing in the minus-Y direction and the base end of the probe with the flight data file books taped on them to touching the right-hand equipment bay. Is that clear - more or less the position that it - it'll be stowed in? Over.</span>

    <span class="words">Okay. Then the - there'll be six points that the probe will be resting on. I won't go into all of those, but we'll identify those as we go. And determine where, with a pencil or something, mark where these points are, and then remove the probe from that location. And on three of those positions we'll have to shim them up. One of the -one of these contact points will be shimmed with a sleeping bag, on top of which we'll put one of the rendezvous window shades and, on top of that, a flight data file book. One of the other shim points - one of the other contact points will be shimmed with a flight data book, and the third point will probably take a couple of flight data books to fill up the gap. Once we get the shims in place, we'll put the probe back down and check that all six contact points are indeed making contact. And then we go through a fairly - well about five steps of rope tieing, I won't go into the details, but we've got it all figured out where each rope coming from the A-6 footpads goes to on the probe and then back down to various other places, essentially lashing the whole thing down between points on A-6 and A-10. And as a final step, using tools that we've got for you from the toolkit, tools that we have identified, we'll take apart one of the support arms, we'll remove the bolt that holds that support arm to the shock strut, and then tie the loose support arm to the probe with the last rope to keep it from flopping around. This takes that support arm out of the couch stroke envelope. And that'll do it. How's that, clear as mud?</span>

The questions that you'll be asked at this news conference have been submitted here at the Manned Spacecraft Center by newsmen who have been covering the flight. Some of the questions they raised have been answered in your communications with Mission Control, but the public-at-large has not necessarily heard them. The questions are being read to you exactly as submitted by the newsmen and in an order specified by them. First of all, for Al and Ed. Cone Crater was your major objective on your second moonwalk. You almost made the rim. How close do you think you got, and do you believe you collected enough rocks and samples to accomplish the purpose of your mission?</span>

    <span class="afjwho">CDR:</span>
    <span class="words">I think so. Let me take the first part of it, with respect to how close we got. I think we were within perhaps 100 yards or less of the rim and certainly in a boulder field that was right there associated with the boulders in the rim.</span>

    <span class="words">Yes. We didn't have a great deal of trouble moving around the rocks. We didn't even have trouble moving the MET around the rocks, except we did have to dodge them and, of course, had to be a bit more careful with the MET that - walking without it. Our major problem, however, was the undulating sur -terrain where you sLMPly couldn't see more than 100 to 150 yards away from you and see landmarks. Consequently, you were never quite sure what landmark would appear when you topped the next ridge, and we were very surprised when we topped the ridge - approached the ridge which we thought to be the rim of Cone Crater to find there was another one beyond it, and that was the beginning of the real problem.</span>

    <span class="words">Well, I guess we didn't realize that we had problems of fatigue and visibility. As far as we were concerned, our only problem was the amount of time allotted for the excursion. We - I don't exactly know what our heart rates were. Obviously, they were higher than the normal sitting rate, but we still were not operating at maximum capacity of our backpacks for cooling, nor were we operating for extended periods of time at high heart rate. To us, it was Just a matter of working against the clock. I think that we had the capability to go longer from the standpoint of fatigue. I don't believe that we were disoriented or lost at any -any time at all, either.</span>

    <span class="afjwho">LMP:</span>
    <span class="words">Yes, I agree with Al. If my previous answer misled you, it was only a matter of context, because, given a few minutes to look around, we figured out where we were, but trying to do it rapidly made it difficult; and, as Al says, time was our major factor. Given another 30 or 40 minutes, I think we could have reached the top of Cone Crater, covered all of our objectives, and - get back in good fashion.</span>

    <span class="afjwhen">194:34:22</span>
    <span class="afjwho">CDR:</span>
    <span class="words">Well, let me add one thing here. I think if we had wanted to reach the top of the crater, and did nothing else, that we could have done that within the time period allotted. But I think that this method in which we reverted to, that of collecting rocks from a point not quite near the top of the crater, provided a lot more geologically, and gave us a better cross section of the rocks in the area, and, therefore, a better chance of getting rocks ejected from Imbrium than had we gone to the crater and back and not collected as many rocks.</span>

It just showed up as a - as a white - a white spot, obviously something foreign to the lunar surface, reflecting light, but the ringer was the long shadow put out. The first day that I tracked it, why, the Sun angle was still pretty low; and you could, see the shadow coming out; and the shadow and the - and the reflection cinched it as the LM. Now, you couldn't see a shape of the LM, as such, but - was no doubt the LM was there. And on the next day, as I was doing landmark tracking, it was not on - in the schedule to track the LM again; however, I had a. landmark just prior to the Fra Mauro region and one after it. And I was in forma -the right attitude for landmark tracking; so, I looked for the LM again - found it this time without any trouble. The shadow had diminished to -to almost nothing, or it was very small; but, here again, then, I could see the glint coming off the ALSEP. At this time, the ALSEP had been deployed; so, I could see the glint coming off it. And I checked with Ron Evans later on the - and told him what I thought it was, and he agreed that that was the ALSEP location.</span>

As far as the landing was concerned, there was - there was less dust than I figured; and I think that was generally borne out as we progressed through our EVA; but the dust started forming, I think, approximately 100 feet above the surface, maybe 150. It was a thin layer, as we've seen before but less dense than what I expected. And it did not interfere with my vision or capability to land at all. Now, do you want to talk about how it was on the surface?</span>

It clings very readily to equipment, to your suits, and it's - it's a nuisance. But surprisingly, we didn't find that we had too much of it on the LM with us in the evening - rather the first night, nor did we feel we carried too much of it back in with us after the second EVA, except for the fact that it was - had LMPreg - LMPregnated the top of the suits and was on most other pieces of cloth. However, it came off of the metal very readily, and that didn't cause any problem. I think it was more of a nuisance than anything else.</span>

They - Of course, A1 and Ed took their suits off in the - in the LM; and then, we have a vacuum cleaner in the command module and which I passed over; and they vacuumed the suits. And I passed over several bags in which they put all of the equipment that they brought from the lunar surface into these bags. They have zippers on them and so forth that are to keep the fine dust in. So, I took each one of their suits and put it in a special suit bag that we have in here and another bag that they came back across; and by holding a little positive pressure in the command module, we - we've had very - very little dust, and absolutely no -no problem at all.</span>

With respect to size, I think the largest we brought back is about a foot in its diameter, and the large rocks we've brought back were not crumbly. Some of the rock specimens, the smaller hand samples which we collected, were, in fact, crumbly; but the large rocks we brought back, I think we have four or five relatively large rocks.

    <span class="words">No. With respect to the general terrain, it was exactly as we had expected. As a matter of fact, as soon as the vehicle pitched over in the final stages of the landing approach, I was immediately able to recognize where we were and could control the spacecraft accordingly. We were essentially right on target, and we landed essentially right on target. I had originally planned to land a little bit to the south of the designated spot, perhaps within a couple hundred yards, because I thought it was smoother there. It turned out that there really was no smooth place within the general area of the landing site. As far as the slope was concerned, there was something like a 7-degree slope, and it didn't give us any problem at all. The LM landed very softly, gently. No tendency for it to topple over, and it stayed there steady as a rock for the duration of the stay.</span>

And you Rogered and we checked the transcript - but this call was made about an hour prior to actually starting the high flow - and then later when - after I came on during the low flow part of the DIO - I called -you went on a TANK 3 HEATER cycle - the heater TEMP hit the upper limit and we asked for the heater switch OFF. We asked you to check and you confirmed that the TANK 3 50-WATT breaker was in and that you must have missed it earlier. Now, the problem is - that the engineers who are analyzing the data from the - whole DTO are not sure where the circuit breaker was during the entire period of the DTO, and it really doesn't matter whether the circuit breaker was in or out, as long as we know where it was during the test. Can you tell us the history of the position of the breaker during the high flow portion? Was it ever pulled prior to my call on the temperature going out of limits - and if so - when was it pulled, and then when did it get put back in? Over.</span>

I was over - Oh, when I did the 0^ - when I closed the 0^ ISOL AUX BATTERY switch - I saw at that time that the 50 1 HEATER was in and I vaguely remembered it should be out and yet it was in and that's when it was noticed. When it went in - I don't know, but it was definitely pulled on call and I was surprised to find it back in when I reconfigured after the test - and you called us shortly after that.</span>

"A powerful earthquake hit southern California at 8:01 central standard time today, causing two reported deaths, numerous injuries, and cracked buildings and highways. The jolting trembler was felt over at least 350 miles from Fresno to below the Mexican border. But damage was worse in Los Angeles and its heavily populated San Fernando Valley. The center of the shock was reported at 17 miles north of the valley in the rugged San Gabriel Mountains. Major damage is reported in the two closest towns of Newhall and Saugus, 35 miles northwest of downtown L.A. The magnitude of the shock was rated at between 6 and 6.5 on the Richter scale, which rates major quakes at 7 or more. It was the strongest quake in the Los Angeles area since the 1952 trembler at Tehachapi to the north, which had the magnitude of 7.2 and was strongly felt in L.A. It killed 13 persons. The San Francisco earthquake was 8.25." Over.</span>
