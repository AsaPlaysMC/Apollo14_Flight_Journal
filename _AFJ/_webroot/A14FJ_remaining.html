<div class="onboard"><b>091:39:50 Roosa (onboard): </b>I just saw a flash - with my eyes wide open.</div>
<div><b>098:01:55 Mitchell: </b>Be advised that - okay, understand. Be advised that the HIGH GAIN, I've tried manual procedures and about three-quarters of that signal strength I can get.</div>
<div><b>098:36:13 Roosa: </b>Good morning, Houston. 14 here.</div>
<div><b>098:36:17 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. Roger. Good evening, Stu.</div>
<div><b>098:36:26 Roosa: </b>Good evening? It's good morning, Bruce baby.</div>
<div><b>098:36:30 CC: </b>Roger. How'd you all sleep?</div>
<div><b>098:36:47 Roosa: </b>And Bruce, I've got a crew status report for you.</div>
<div><b>098:36:50 CC: </b>Okay. Go ahead with your crew status report.</div>
<div><b>098:36:56 Roosa: </b>Okay. Al: 6 hours of sleep, dosimeter, 16048; Ed: 6 hours, 01046; and 6 hours, 05038.</div>
<div><b>098:37:12 CC: </b>Okay. Understand 6 hours of sleep each, 16o48, 01046, and 05038. Over.</div>
<div><b>098:37:27 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>098:37:30 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. At this time, we would like the CMP and the LMP to swap dosimeters. The LMP dosimeter is inoperative, and we would like to have two active dosimeters on the lunar surface. Over.</div>
<div><b>098:37:47 Roosa: </b>Okay. We'll do that.</div>
<div><b>098:38:16 CC: </b>And, 14; this is Houston. Would you confirm a negative presleep status report. Over.</div>
<div><b>098:38:28 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative. We went to bed all healthy, no medication, and we're getting up the same way.</div>
<div><b>098:38:35 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>098:38:54 CC: </b>Okay. When you're interested, I have about four or five general information-type items to pass up to you all.</div>
<div><b>098:39:06 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. This is something - we should all be on the headset for? If it is, we should Just wait a few minutes.</div>
<div><b>098:39:14 CC: </b>Yes. Why don't we do that? There's no great rush in any of them, but we've got 24 minutes to LOS. And just let me know when you're ready.</div>
<div><b>098:39:26 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll take a consumables update, anytime you've got it. We'll get that out of the way, if you want to give it to me now.</div>
<div><b>098:39:33 CC: </b>Okay, I'll have the consumables update for you momentarily. In the meantime, we'd like you to read out the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA meters and the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA knobs. It has not been switching to NARROW BEAM at AOS. We're not sure why, right now. We's like to leave the configuration as is and get those read-outs. Over.</div>
<div><b>098:40:10 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce, the -</div>
<div><b>098:40:15 Mitchell: </b>Bruce, this is Ed. I got my biomed on, and I got the sensor corrected. Have the medics take a look at it while you're talking to Stu, please.</div>
<div><b>098:40:23 CC: </b>I understand you have your biomed hooked up, and the sensor is connected, and you'd like the medics to look at it.</div>
<div><b>098:40:30 Mitchell: </b>That's affirm.</div>
<div><b>098:40:32 CC: </b>We're in LOW BIT RATE right now, Ed. You'll have to hold on a minute.</div>
<div><b>098:40:42 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce, the read-outs on the PITCH meter is 50 degrees, on the YAW meter is 270, on the knob, it's set at 35; and the - PITCH - YAW knob is set ? at 275-</div>
<div><b>098:41:06 CC: </b>Okay, Stu, on pitch, is that plus or minus? Over.</div>
<div><b>098:41:12 Roosa: </b>Oh, sorry about that. Both are minuses.</div>
<div><b>098:41:15 CC: </b>Okay. Meter: PITCH, minus 50; YAW, 270; knob, minus 35 and 275. Over.</div>
<div><b>098:41:27 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>098:41:29 CC: </b>Okay; coming at you with a consumables update. Over.</div>
<div><b>098:41:36 Roosa: </b>And let her rip.</div>

<div><b>098:42:10 Roosa: </b>Roger. Copy the GET 99 hours; RCS total, 74; quads, 73, 75, 73, 75; hydrogen, 65, 65; 0 , 85, 83, 31.</div>
<div><b>098:42:27 CC: </b>Roger, out.</div>
<div><b>098:42:43 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>098:42:44 CC: </b>Go ahead, Ed.</div>
<div><b>098:42:50 Mitchell: </b>Are you going to switch over to HIGH BIT RATE so you can look at this? I'd like to go ahead and start suiting up.</div>
<div><b>098:42:55 CC: </b>Stand by.</div>
<div><b>098:43:17 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. We request HIGH GAIN ANTENNA SERVO ELECTRONICS to SECONDARY. Over.</div>
<div><b>098:43:28 Mitchell: </b>Okay. ... - -</div>
<div><b>098:43:29 Roosa: </b>Okay; going to SECONDARY.</div>
<div><b>098:45:11 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Request S-BAND NORMAL, TRANSPONDER, SECONDARY. Over.</div>
<div><b>098:45:22 Mitchell: </b>Roger. TRANSPONDER, SECONDARY.</div>
<div><b>098:46:08 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>098:46:14 Mitchell: </b>Loud and clear. How me?</div>
<div><b>098:46:15 CC: </b>Roger; reading you the same.</div>
<div><b>098:47:00 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>098:47:03 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>098:47:07 Mitchell: </b>I'd appreciate an answer on your intentions relative to the sensor.</div>
<div><b>098:47:11 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. Relative to the sensor, we require a HIGH BIT RATE down here in order for the surgeon to get any biomed telemetry. We're attempting to get HIGH BIT RATE at the present time, as evidenced by our request for SECONDARY ELECTRONICS on the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA and the SECONDARY TRANSPONDER, We'll let you know just as soon as we can press on. Perhaps, in the meantime, you could tell us which sensor you think was giving you the problem and what you've done in the meantime to it. Over.</div>
<div><b>098:47:43 Mitchell: </b>Okay, the lower sternum sensor was leaking, and we replaced it last evening, and it seemed to be the only one that had a chance to he in had shape.</div>
<div><b>098:47:59 CC: </b>We copy. Out.</div>
<div><b>098:48:01 Mitchell: </b>... to be the only one that looked like it might be ...</div>
<div><b>098:48:03 CC: </b>Roger out. And -</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>098:51:18 Shepard (onboard): </b></div>
<div class="onboard"><b>098:51:21 Roosa (onboard): </b>No, I didn't eat that last night. Never got around to it. Why don't you just leave it there? Maybe I'll eat it.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>098:51:28 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Houston, 14. Do you read?</div>
<div><b>098:51:28 Mitchell: </b>Houston. 14. Do you read?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>098:51:29 Roosa (onboard): </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>098:51:31 CC (onboard): </b>Roger, Ed. We're reading you. We'd like you to do a normal manual acquisition, switching back to WIDE BEAM and then coming on over.</div>
<div><b>098:51:31 CC: </b>Roger, Ed. We're reading you. We'd like you to do a normal manual acquisition, switching back the WIDE BEAM and then coming on over.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>098:51:42 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>098:51:42 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>098:52:12 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay. I'll start mixing up some chow. A1, what would you like first?</div>
<div><b>098:53:03 Mitchell: </b>Houston, I have you on AUTO and NARROW again, and I cannot seem to get the signal strength above about the three-quarter mark.</div>
<div><b>098:53:14 CC: </b>Roger. I'm reading you with a good bit of noise in the background, Ed.</div>
<div><b>098:54:09 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. We request you attempt acquisition again using the normal manual procedures. Over.</div>
<div><b>098:54:20 Mitchell: </b>Roger. Roger.</div>
<div><b>098:56:09 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. We suggest HIGH GAIN ANTENNA angles of PITCH, minus 25; YAW, 280. I say it again: PITCH, minus 25; YAW, 280. Over.</div>
<div><b>098:56:52 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. We suggest HIGH GAIN ANTENNA; PITCH, minus 25; that is minus 25; YAW, 280; YAW, 280. Over.</div>
<div><b>098:59:30 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you - -</div>
<div><b>098:59:32 Mitchell: </b>Houston, Apollo lU. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>098:59:33 CC: </b>- - minutes to LOS.</div>
<div><b>098:59:34 CC: </b>Roger. Loud and clear, now, Ed. We've got 4 - -</div>
<div><b>098:59:37 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Bruce. You're loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>098:59:49 CC: </b>Apollo 14 - -</div>
<div><b>098:59:50 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>098:59:51 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Stu. We've got 4 minutes until LOS. I have a four-step procedure for testing the lunar topo camera, if you are ready to listen and copy?</div>
<div><b>099:00:06 Roosa: </b>Stand hy 1, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>099:00:08 CC: </b>Roger. We're standing hy.</div>
<div><b>099:00:24 Roosa: </b>Okay, go ahead Bruce,</div>
<div><b>099:00:27 CC: </b>Okay. With respect to the Hycon, we think this may be a low-current problem. We've been able to duplicate most of your symptoms down here in Building 4 with the other model. What we'd like you to do is - step 1: disconnect all power connectors, inspect, and reconnect. Over.</div>
<div><b>099:01:02 Roosa: </b>Okay. This baby reads disconnect all power connectors, inspect, and reconnect. And I guess -you know, we - we do that when we put it in and out, if I understand your step right. I mean, they're all disconnected. I guess you mean just look at the pins and so forth. Amplify that just a little bit, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>099:01:23 CC: </b>That's correct. We'd just like you to inspect for bent pins, any sort of damage, cracked insulators; anything like that you can find in error. Break, break, for Ed. We are unable to verify your biomed harness at this time. We'd like you to change out biomed harness. Do not suit up, and we'll check it over at AOS, next pass. Over.</div>
<div><b>099:01:48 Mitchell: </b>Roger. Understand. Change out the biomed harness, and do not suit up.</div>
<div><b>099:01:52 CC: </b>Roger. You can - you can suit up partially - -</div>
<div><b>099:02:02 CC: </b>Roger. We copy on the HIGH GAIN. You can suit up partially if you want to take the risk of having to unsuit a little ways. Break, break, for Stu. Step 2: we'd like you to switch non-essential power to opposite MAIN DC BUS, that is, from B to A or A to B, whatever you were on last time. Step 3: reset control box film counter to zero; shutter speed to l/200th of a second; with magazine removed, visually examine the shutter-curtain slit position. If the slit is visible, it should not be more than 1 inch from the magazine guide rail. Examine sprocket area for visible tears. Step 4: install magazine Whiskey and actuate single frame. Remove magazine and verify slit is not more than 1 inch from magazine guide rail, if visible. Thirty seconds to LOS. I repeat, switch from nonessential power from BUS B to A or A to B, opposite what you had. Reset control box film counter to zero and shutter to l/200th; with magazine removed, visually examine shutter-curtain slit position; if visible, slit should not be more than 1 inch frcm magazine guide rail. Examine sprocket area for visible tears; install magazine Whiskey and actuate single frame. Remove magazine and verify slit is not more than 1 inch from magazine guide rail. We'll talk, to you on AOS next time on the results.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:04:13 Roosa (onboard): </b>Was that LOS? Must have dropped them. Yes. How in the hell does Bruce think I'm going to copy that shit like that? Oh, he said, \"Well, we're 40 seconds from LOS,\" so he just starts reading, you know, just as fast as he can; and, you know, there's no way you can - -</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:04:30 Shepard (onboard): </b>... Hycon.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:04:33 Roosa (onboard): </b>Yes, this is - what we're going to do with the Hycon - They said they duplicated all the problems in the - in building 4, and it's a low-power problem, and they got all the - all the symptoms. I don't know why they want me to ... - -</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:04:54 SC (onboard): </b></div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:05:14 Roosa (onboard): </b>Let's get out the flight plan there.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:05:17 SC (onboard): </b></div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:05:22 Roosa (onboard): </b>Verify DSE tape motion; LOW BIT RATE. Yes. It's moving. Okay. We verified that. Now we're in an eat period.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:05:39 SC (onboard): </b></div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:05:48 Roosa (onboard): </b>Well, they don't want him to do anything until the AOS, at least, which is at 100:30.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:05:51 Shepard (onboard): </b></div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:06:13 Roosa (onboard): </b>Cried the king.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:07:04 Roosa (onboard): </b>Screw them, said the commander, and all the subjects began to fornicate. That was a Rocsa original, 1971, at 99 hours and 47 minutes into the midnight flight of Apollo 14.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:07:29 SC (onboard): </b>...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:07:31 Roosa (onboard): </b>Yes, okay. Now, you - you went through the manual procedures, and you get three-quarters signal strength?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:07:36 Mitchell (onboard): </b></div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:08:45 Roosa (onboard): </b>Would you - would you like some more? I got several packages here. I don't - I just don't chew gum, and I - pack rat, like in survival, you -I save everything that I don't - -</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:09:38 Shepard (onboard): </b>... number ... on the top and the bottom ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:10:08 Roosa (onboard): </b>I think that'd be a good plan.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:14:25 Mitchell (onboard): </b>I'm sure shey've got some - some rule that's mandatory for the biomeds for the EVA.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:14:59 Roosa (onboard): </b>You want to bet a six-pack? I mean, I don't know, but I'm just - the way the system operates.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:16:01 Roosa (onboard): </b>I don't know why Bruce was in such a hurry to do this Hycon troubleshooting, anyway. I don't knew when he thinks I'm going to do that.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>099:56:03 CC (onboard): </b>Okay. In the meantime, an item of general interest or, your orbital status.

<div><b>099:56:03 CC: </b>Okay. In the meantime, an item of general interest on your orbital status. You started out somewhat high and are decaying at a slightly greater rate than predicted.

<div class="onboard"><b>099:56:30 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, sounds like good planning.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:56:33 Mitchell (onboard): </b>That gives us more fuel than ever.</div>
<div><b>099:56:34 Roosa: </b>Okay. Sounds like good planning.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>099:57:02 CC (onboard): </b>And, Apollo 14, Stu. Map update, REV 11, if you're ready.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>099:57:07 Roosa (onboard): </b>Negative; stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>099:57:07 Roosa: </b>Negative. Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>099:57:22 CC: </b>Apollo 14; Ed, this is Houston. You're GO to commence suiting up.</div>
<div><b>099:57:32 Mitchell: </b>Roger, Roger. Thank you, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>099:57:34 CC: </b>Biomed's looking good. Apollo 14; Ed, this is Houston. Can you monitor, just for a minute, discussion on the ascent batteries.</div>
<div><b>099:57:51 Mitchell: </b>Roger. I'm on. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>099:57:53 CC: </b>14, Houston. Our feeling right now is that this is a single-cell problem in ascent battery number 5- If one cell were shorted out entirely and completely discharged, this would drop your terminal voltage by 1.8 volts. The expected voltage, open circuit, at activation is greater than 35-3. I say again, it's greater than 35*3. However, the open circuit voltage will not be our criterion. We will use the Delta in voltage between BATs 5 and 6 underload to evaluate battery 5. If there is more than a 1.8-volt Delta between 5 and 6 - that is, if it should turn out that you have a problem with more than one cell, then battery 5 will be NO GO. Over.</div>
<div><b>099:58:55 Mitchell: </b>Understand, Houston, that if, in subsequent checks, we have more than one cell that shows up bad, battery 5 will be NO GO.</div>
<div><b>099:59:06 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>099:59:11 Roosa: </b>Okay. And I'm ready for the REV 11 update, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>099:59:15 CC: </b>14, Houston. REV 11, 180 degrees, 102:03:40. Understand you don't need LOS or AOS; they're close to nominal.</div>
<div><b>099:59:46 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. I've got a lot of noise in the background now. Did you copy the time for 180, 102:03:40? Over.</div>
<div><b>100:01:01 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read now? Over.</div>
<div><b>100:01:38 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>100:01:44 Roosa: </b>Loud and clear, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>100:01:46 CC: </b>Okay. We're reading you again, Stu. We'd like you to go with MANUAL and MEDIUM BEAM width, please.</div>
<div><b>100:01:55 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>100:02:26 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. The antenna seemed to oscillate a little bit, there. It's steadied out now with a reasonably good signal - -</div>
<div><b>100:02:31 CC: </b>Say, that looks beautiful. That looks beautiful, Stu.</div>
<div><b>100:02:39 Roosa: </b>Okay - -</div>
<div><b>100:02:40 CC: </b>Stu, did you copy the time for 180-degree meridian, 102:03:40?</div>
<div><b>100:02:51 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative; 102:03:40.</div>
<div><b>100:02:54 CC: </b>Roger. Were you able to run through the LTC camera checkout procedures 1 through 4, or we fade out on you before you got them?</div>
<div><b>100:03:04 Roosa: </b>That's negative on being able to run through them. I didn't even begin to get them copied, Bruce. I guess - I need to - What time frame are you thinking of me troubleshooting that one? Is that something that we need to worry about right now?</div>
<div><b>100:03:18 CC: </b>No, we'll hold off on that.</div>
<div><b>100:03:43 CC: </b>Okay, 14. On the subject of the docking probe situation, for undocking, we anticipate a normal undocking sequence, that is, extension followed by release of the LM. If there should be no release at this time, we request that you hold the RELEASE position of the EXTEND/RELEASE switch and both vehicles thrust minus-X for 3 seconds, and then RELEASE on the - or return the switch to center. Over.</div>
<div><b>100:04:28 Roosa: </b>Okay. Understand; we're anticipating a normal SEP. If we get on the end of the probe and no release, we'll both thrust minus-X for 3 seconds.</div>
<div><b>100:04:39 CC: </b>Roger. While you hold the switch in the RELEASE position. And we've got some other procedures that we'll run through in real time, if the requirement develops, in order to accomplish an undocking. We would like to say at this time, though, that we are not considering blowing the docking ring in order to undock. Over.</div>
<div><b>100:05:06 Roosa: </b>Okay. That sounds reasonable.</div>
<div><b>100:05:10 CC: </b>And is A1 listening?</div>
<div><b>100:05:16 Roosa: </b>A1 is not on the headset right now, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>100:05:19 CC: </b>Okay. I wonder if you'd pass to him that when he and Ed go over into the LM, they should either carry with them a tool R, that's tool Romeo, from the command module, or, if he should have such a thing as a screwdriver, bit, or something like that available, why that would also suffice. Over.</div>
<div><b>100:05:46 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll let him borrow a tool R, I guess, on a hand receipt, and he'll take that over with him.</div>
<div><b>100:05:54 CC: </b>Roger. Be sure and get a QC stamp on it.</div>
<div><b>100:06:01 Roosa: </b>21 Nancy.</div>
<div><b>100:06:03 CC: </b>(Laughter) Roger; 21 Nancy. Hey, a little more background on that - thing that we're looking for, of course, would be an item such as tool R that would enable our crewmen from the LM to depress the capture latch release button on the tip of the probe from the LM side, and tool R will fill this bill, or this other screwdriver, if it were available. Over.</div>
<div><b>100:06:32 Roosa: </b>Okay. We got you.</div>
<div><b>100:06:36 CC: </b>And with respect to docking, again we anticipate normal operation. However, we'd like to add to the normal procedures a LM plus-X thrust of 10 seconds, four-jet RCS, to facilitate or to give us just a little more of a warm feeling on the docking. Once again, we have some backup procedures that we can run through in real time, if these should prove necessary, and, in order to formalize this, I've got a flight-plan update for the CMP Solo Book and for the LM Time Line Book whenever you all are ready to copy these down.</div>
<div><b>100:07:28 Roosa: </b>Okay. Stand by here and let's get out the LM Time Line.</div>
<div><b>100:07:34 CC: </b>Roger. I'll do likewise down here. And we'll make them together.</div>
<div><b>100:07:41 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>100:07:46 CC: </b>And since you don't have a lot going on up there right now, Stu, I wondered if you could give us P00 and ACCEPT, and we'll send you up some uplinks We've got a state vector, a desired orientor REFSMMAT, a - and that's it.</div>
<div><b>100:08:04 Roosa: </b>Okay, You have P00 and ACCEPT.</div>
<div><b>100:08:15 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. You seem to be fading out a little bit Are you close enough to the mike?</div>
<div><b>100:08:24 Roosa: </b>I - I'm talking right into them, Bruce. You have P00 and ACCEPT.</div>
<div><b>100:08:28 CC: </b>Roger. Thank you. And would you return to the NARROW dead band five-tenths of a degree in the DAP, please?</div>
<div><b>100:08:38 Roosa: </b>Okay. Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>100:08:40 CC: </b>That's in reference to keeping the HIGH GAIN pointed right at us here.</div>
<div><b>100:08:46 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>100:09:43 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'm NARROW dead band. I'm through with the DSKY if you want to press with the uplink, and looks like we got good signal strength here.</div>
<div><b>100:09:50 CC: </b>Okay. It looks real good here, Stu, and we'll press on with the uplink. And I got my Time Line Book out and we're going to page 14.</div>
<div><b>100:10:01 Roosa: </b>Okay. We'll have to stand by on that LM Time Line Book for a little bit here, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>100:10:05 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>100:10:15 CC: </b>And back on the subject of the drogue, I guess our analysis down here and all the data that we've been able to come up with indicates that you did, in fact, have a normal retraction on the last attempt. The selection of a bottle did not contribute to the capture in itself, and we've passed you the procedures here that we'd like you to run through.</div>
<div><b>100:10:41 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>100:11:58 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>100:12:00 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>100:12:06 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. I - just something that seems like back from memory in debriefing from 11 - they tried this plus-X on the IM and docking and they got some - if I remember right - some attitude excursions. Is everybody satisfied that the LM can plus-X and everything will be stable?</div>
<div><b>100:12:51 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Roger. We recalled 11, and the biggest part of the problem there was that both vehicles were actively trying to control attitude. The procedure which we'll be passing up to you has you going into CMC MODE, FREE, prior to the IM commencing its plus-X thrusting. Over.</div>
<div><b>100:13:19 Roosa: </b>Okay. So I guess we'll - we'll wait until we get the changes, and then we'll talk about it, if we've got any questions.</div>
<div><b>100:13:25 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>100:18:14 CC: </b>14, Houston. I have your CMC REFSMMAT zero time update for you. There is no GET or T , update . , i. ephem ^ required. Over.</div>
<div><b>100:18:31 Roosa: </b>Okay. And I'm ready to copy, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>100:18:34 CC: </b>Okay, CMC REFSMMAT zero zero time is 108 hours 53 minutes 58.00 seconds. And I'll have the TEI-19 pad shortly. You want to go ahead and read back?</div>
<div><b>100:18:53 Roosa: </b>Okay, REFSMMAT zero zero time, 108 - 108?53:58.00.</div>
<div><b>100:19:01 CC: </b>Roger, readback correct. I'll be coming at you with the TEI-19 pad in about 10 seconds.</div>
<div><b>100:19:09 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>100:19:35 CC: </b>And if you're ready to copy on TEI-19, I'm ready.</div>
<div><b>100:19:49 Roosa: </b>Okay, TEI-19; let her go, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>100:19:53 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. SPS/G&N; 36583; minus 0.66, plus 0.24; T. , 119:38:09.13; NOUN 8l, plus 2903.4, plus 1564.7, minus 0485.2; roll, 179, 120, 029- The rest of the pad is NA. Ullage, four jets, 11 seconds. Remarks: this is an undocked burn. We assume circularization, but no plane change number 1. The lunar longitude that you are crossing at time of T. is minus 175-8 west longitude. Over, ig</div>
<div><b>100:21:23 Roosa: </b>Okay, TEI-19; SPS/G&N; 36583; minus 0.66, plus 0.24; 119:38:09.13; plus 2903.4, plus 1564.7, minus 0485.2; 179, 120, 029. Ullage, four jet, 11 seconds; undocked, assumed CIRC, no plane change 1; and longitude of Tig. minus 175.8.</div>
<div><b>100:22:06 CC: </b>14, this is Houston; readback correct. Out.</div>
<div><b>100:22:14 Roosa: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>100:24:10 Roosa: </b>And, Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>100:24:12 CC: </b>Go ahead, Stu.</div>
<div><b>100:24:16 Roosa: </b>Okay, the IM/command module DELTA-P is 0.8.</div>
<div><b>100:24:22 CC: </b>Houston, Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>100:25:06 CC: </b>Stu, Houston. How is your viewing attitude up there?</div>
<div><b>100:25:14 Roosa: </b>It's rather tremendous, Bruce. This - Coming across this low - low orbit is phenomenal, and this attitude is absolutely great.</div>
<div><b>100:25:28 CC: </b>I guess that settles that one.</div>
<div><b>100:26:03 Roosa: </b>I tell you one thing, Bruce; you sure get the LMPression you're more like about a thousand feet than 45,000.</div>
<div><b>100:26:13 CC: </b>I guess the scenery is really clipping along.</div>
<div><b>100:26:19 Roosa: </b>Yes, and it seems so close. It looks like you can Just reach out and touch it.</div>
<div><b>100:26:26 CC: </b>The recent input from FA0 is that we need the Hycon camera check prior to a GET of 107 hours. That's about 6 hours from now.</div>
<div><b>100:26:42 Roosa: </b>Okay, prior 107. And we'll sure try to give it a go.</div>
<div><b>100:26:48 CC: </b>Roger. And whenever you're ready on the flight-plan update to the CMP Solo Book and the IM Time Line Book, why, we've got it setting down here, but there's no rush.</div>
<div><b>100:27:00 Roosa: </b>Okay, I can take the CMP Solo Book now, but we might as well get them both together, and it'11 be a little bit here. They're getting their suits on.</div>
<div><b>100:27:09 CC: </b>Okay. Well, the details of the two are a little different.</div>
<div><b>100:27:20 Roosa: </b>Okay, lets get me out of the way and take the Solo Book now.</div>
<div><b>100:27:26 CC: </b>Okay, on page 52.</div>
<div><b>100:27:43 Roosa: </b>Okay, go ahe ad.</div>
<div><b>100:27:47 CC: </b>At 144 hours and 08 minutes, it presently reads, "Translate to capture latch," we want to change that to read, "Translate to contact." Over.</div>
<div><b>100:28:11 Roosa: </b>Okay, we'll change that "Translate to contact," and hope they're both the same, huh?</div>
<div><b>100:28:16 CC: </b>Roger, Roger. Under that, add in "Report contacts to LM;" and "CMC MODE, FREE." Over.</div>
<div><b>100:28:43 Roosa: </b>Okay/ and after contact, I'll report contact to IM and go CMC, FREE.</div>
<div><b>100:28:49 CC: </b>Roger. And over there in the "Docking checklist," we want to delete the "CMC MODE, FREE." It says, "Docking checklist at capture, CMC MODE, FREE;" you can delete that.</div>
<div><b>100:29:03 Roosa: </b>Okay, I'll delete "CMC MODE, FREE" under the "Docking checklist at capture."</div>
<div><b>100:29:08 CC: </b>And that's it. That wasn't so bad, was it?</div>
<div><b>100:29:13 Roosa: </b>No, that was pretty painless.</div>
<div><b>100:29:15 CC: </b>21 Nancy.</div>
<div><b>100:29:19 Roosa: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>100:31:17 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>100:31:23 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>100:31:24 CC: </b>Yes, Stu; we just got word that your family is listening to you, and they're outside looking up at that great big Fra Mauro Moon.</div>
<div><b>100:31:36 Roosa: </b>Thank you.</div>
<div><b>100:31:57 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce; for their benefit - just to pinpoint us, we're approaching the terminator now and the Fra Mauro formation. And I guess of all the views you see, I think it's going to be tough to beat this - going into the terminator at this low altitude. It's - it's really something.</div>
<div><b>100:32:17 CC: </b>It sounds really spectacular. I'm sure we'd all like to be up there with you. I know I would.</div>
<div><b>100:32:24 Roosa: </b>Yes, I wish you could be - yes, I wish you could be, after all that hard work.</div>
<div><b>100:32:54 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. We'd like to try the SECONDARY SERVO ELECTRONICS on the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA and attempt a normal acquisition. If that is unsuccessful, we'll return to the present configuration.</div>
<div><b>100:33:13 Roosa: </b>All right, Bruce; go on SECONDARY, now.</div>
<div><b>100:33:29 Roosa: </b>Okay, how do you read, Bruce?</div>
<div><b>100:33:31 CC: </b>Loud and clear, Stu. Looks beautiful.</div>
<div><b>100:33:36 Roosa: </b>Yes. I went SECONDARY, and there was not a glitch in - in anything.</div>
<div><b>100:33:42 CC: </b>Are you in AUTO now?</div>
<div><b>100:33:47 Roosa: </b>Oh, no. I am - I'm sorry. I didn't get the AUTO bit.</div>
<div><b>100:33:50 CC: </b>Great.</div>
<div><b>100:33:51 Roosa: </b>I thought you Just wanted SECONDARY on the ELECTRONICS.</div>
<div><b>100:33:56 CC: </b>Great. Now that you - -</div>
<div><b>100:33:58 Roosa: </b>You - you want AUTO MODE? Is that - -</div>
<div><b>100:34:00 CC: </b>Now that you've got the SECONDARD SERVO ELECTRONICS up, we'd like you to run through a normal acquisition procedure; over.</div>
<div><b>100:34:10 Roosa: </b>Oh, okay.</div>
<div><b>100:35:07 Roosa: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>100:35:10 CC: </b>Okay, loud and clear, Stu. It looks like it was successful. I understand - -</div>
<div><b>100:35:16 Roosa: </b>That's negative. I'm back in MANUAL and MEDIUM. What happens when I go to AUTO - the PITCH goes to about a minus 50 and the YAW stays just about the same, but it seems like the AUTO MODE wants to drive the PITCH down to about minus 50; and if I do that in - in - in WIDE BEAM width and then I go to MEDIUM, NARROW, it doesn't seem to have any effect, and the signal strength drops back off.</div>
<div><b>100:35:51 CC: </b>Okay, we copy, Stu.</div>
<div><b>100:35:56 Roosa: </b>And I'm back MANUAL, MEDIUM now.</div>
<div><b>100:36:00 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>100:44:18 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. We have your torquing angles. You're GO.</div>
<div><b>100:44:46 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. Torqued at 101, 24, 20.</div>
<div><b>100:44:50 CC: </b>101, 24, 20.</div>
<div><b>100:48:53 CC: </b>14; Stu, this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>100:48:59 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>100:49:01 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. Prior to commencing your maneuver here, which it looks like you're about ready to do, we'll give you an OMNI antenna to select. Once you get to the new attitude, we'd like you to return to MANUAL, MEDIUM BEAM width, and we'll give you PITCH and YAW angles. Over.</div>
<div><b>100:49:19 Roosa: </b>All right, we're getting ready to manuever. Have you got the angles?</div>
<div><b>100:49:30 CC: </b>Okay, Stuart. OMNI Bravo while maneuvering, and and the flight-plan angles of a PITCH, minus 80; and YAW, 98* are good.</div>
<div><b>100:49:47 Roosa: </b>Okay, OMNI Bravo during the maneuver, and flight-plan angles good when we get there. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>100:49:53 CC: </b>Roger. And with respect to the LM Time Line Book, we'll try to pass this up in real time during the tail end of the rendezvous. You might pass to A1 that it essentially makes the Time Line Book agree with what we gave you in the CMP Solo Book -10 seconds or contact on the thrust X-plus at contact and then confirm docking. Confirm capture report from CSM.</div>
<div><b>100:50:21 Shepard: </b>Okay, Houston. We got that. And passing it up later is fine with us.</div>
<div><b>100:50:25 CC: </b>Roger. We just wanted to make sure you were aware of what we had in mind.</div>
<div><b>100:51:16 CC: </b>14, Houston. Six minutes to LOS.</div>
<div><b>100:51:21 Roosa: </b>Okay. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>100:56:33 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. One minute to LOS.</div>
<div><b>100:56:39 Shepard: </b>Roger, Houston.</div>
<div><b>100:56:42 Mitchell: </b>Okay; 14 is up - on the time line, Houston.</div>
<div><b>100:56:47 CC: </b>Say again?</div>
<div><b>100:56:55 CC: </b>Okay, 14. Down here, we're going to turn over to the good old Gold Team, and the friendly Maroon Team will see you in a few hours.</div>
<div><b>100:57:06 Mitchell: </b>Okay, stick around. We've got ice cream.</div>
<div><b>100:57:11 Shepard: </b>You'll be back for the fun, Bruce?</div>
<div><b>100:57:13 CC: </b>I will; yes, indeed.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>100:57:49 Mitchell (onboard): </b>They got those torquing angles on the ground, didn't they?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>100:57:51 Shepard (onboard): </b>Yes. They said they got them.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>100:57:52 Roosa (onboard): </b>They got the torquing angles, and I passed them ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>100:57:56 Shepard (onboard): </b>Okay. One thing you haven't done, Stu, which you can get later - is your cameras are all here -You have to get that ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>100:58:02 Roosa (onboard): </b>Yes. I - I'll get all those ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>100:58:07 Shepard (onboard): </b>Okay. We're going right through gimbal lock on the GDC, and it's going right by. IMU's fine. Okay. CMP is removing the - tunnel hatch. CMP's removing the probe now. Okay. What was the DELTA-?, by the way, Stu? I'll Just jot it down here.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>100:58:43 Roosa (onboard): </b>0.28. I wrote it down there.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>100:58:46 Shepard (onboard): </b>Oh, did you? Okay. It's down again. Okay. 180 is 102:03:40. Three. That'll be 23:26. I could set it on 34.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>100:59:45 Shepard (onboard): </b>Okay, Stu. Your timer is running - coming up t060, which is - the zero of which will be your 180 update time. Okay. You verify tape motion?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>101:00:05 Mitchell (onboard): </b>That's verified.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>101:00:08 Shepard (onboard): </b>Do I record the tunnel angle as plus 0.9?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>101:00:12 Roosa (onboard): </b></div>
<div class="onboard"><b>101:00:15 Shepard (onboard): </b>All right.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>101:02:02 Shepard (onboard): </b>Do you want to use the spring or you want to use the strap?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>101:02:07 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Need the spring to hold the nose down here.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>101:02:28 Shepard (onboard): </b>Oh, I see what tool R is for, is to take those Phillips-head screws off the whole cover, I guess.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>101:02:45 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Not very tight. Yes. Go around it one. Much better (clearing throat).</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>101:03:15 Shepard (onboard): </b>Let's see - we just leave these out in the hag here, I guess.</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>101:04:54 Mitchell (onboard): </b>I do, too (clearing throat). You didn't put down anything.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>101:05:00 Shepard (onboard): </b>Well, jeez, he had a load on it the other day and the damn thing was holding up, wasn't it?</div>

<div><b>101:59:15 CC: </b>And, Antares; Houston. We have good lock, now; and we'd like to verify you're in AUTO. And the noise - again, we're not knowing what level you're hearing; there is quite a bit of noise with that antenna.</div>
<div><b>101:59:31 Mitchell: </b>I understand that. It's Just surprisingly much more than I expected, and I am in AUTO. And it seems to be holding at a signal, strength of about 3.9, ri ght now.</div>
<div><b>101:59:41 CC: </b>Okay. And, Antares, whenever you get time there to copy, I've got your AGS abort constants ready.</div>
<div><b>102:00:00 Mitchell: </b>Okay. I'd like to hold those for a minute, Fredo.</div>

<div><b>105:45:49 CC: </b>Okay. I see you're back to P00 now. We'd like to do a VERB 11 NOUN 10 ENTER; 30 ENTER; and look at that bit again.</div>
<div><b>105:46:05 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. VERB 11 NOUN 10.</div>
<div><b>105:46:21 Roosa: </b>Houston, Kitty Hawk. Are you through with the computer?</div>
<div><b>105:46:23 CC: </b>Roger, Kitty Hawk. And, while we've got that display up, Ed, could you tap on the panel around the ABORT pushbutton and see if we can shake something loose?</div>
<div><b>105:46:51 Mitchell-LM: </b>Yes, Houston, it just changed while I was tapping there.</div>
<div><b>105:46:54 CC: </b>You sure tap nicely.</div>
<div><b>105:47:00 Mitchell-LM: </b>I'm pretty good at that.</div>
<div><b>105:47:09 CC: </b>Okay. Antares, we'd like to kind of sit here a minute and watch it.</div>
<div><b>105:47:18 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>105:50:03 CC: </b>Antares, Houston.</div>
<div><b>105:50:07 Mitchell-LM: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>105:50:08 CC: </b>Okay, why don't y'all proceed on, Ed, with the landing radar checkout?</div>

<div><b>106:00:18 CC: </b>Okay. That was a good readback, Ed.</div>
<div><b>106:00:25 Roosa: </b>And, Houston; Kitty Hawk. Got all the pads.</div>
<div><b>106:00:29 CC: </b>Roger, Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>106:00:56 CC: </b>Antares, Houston. Could you give us P00 and DATA?</div>
<div><b>106:01:23 CC: </b>Antares, Houston. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>106:01:37 Mitchell-LM: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>106:01:38 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. We'd like P00 and DATA, so we can start uplinking you.</div>
<div><b>106:01:49 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. Okay. You have it.</div>
<div><b>106:02:01 CC: </b>Roger, Antares.</div>
<div><b>106:06:23 CC: </b>Antares, Houston. The computer is yours.</div>
<div><b>106:06:28 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>106:06:50 CC: </b>Antares, Houston. And don't uplink too fast; proceed on by the alarm.</div>
<div><b>106:06:57 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>106:08:13 Mitchell-LM: </b>Houston, Antares. The LPD altitude shows 49,000.</div>
<div><b>106:08:21 CC: </b>Roger, Antares. LPD altitude, 49,000.</div>
<div><b>106:08:30 Mitchell-LM: </b>That's correct.</div>
<div><b>106:13:10 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay, I have Cone Crater, Triplet, and Doublet. They all look just like they're supposed to.</div>
<div><b>106:13:17 CC: </b>Very good, A1.</div>
<div><b>106:13:23 Shepard-LM: </b>And Star - Look right down there - right straight down - -</div>
<div><b>106:13:26 Mitchell-LM: </b>Got them, yes, sure do.</div>
<div><b>106:13:31 Shepard-LM: </b>Yoo-ha! I think we'll know it next time, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>106:13:33 CC: </b>Very good.</div>
<div><b>106:13:38 Mitchell-LM: </b>There they were right below us, big as life.</div>
<div><b>106:15:07 Shepard-LM: </b>Houston from Antares. The landing Sun angle looks very good for the next time around.</div>
<div><b>106:15:13 CC: </b>Roger, Al.</div>
<div><b>106:16:59 Mitchell-LM: </b>Yes, sir. Fredo, the LNA really looks clear today</div>
<div><b>106:17:07 CC: </b>Really does, huh?</div>
<div><b>106:17:27 Mitchell-LM: </b>Fredo, I guess you'll advise us on that abort that - when we come round next time.</div>
<div><b>106:17:32 CC: </b>Yes, I'm working up a little spiel right now, Al.</div>
<div><b>106:17:37 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>106:18:26 Roosa: </b>Okay, Fredo. Tracking on 14-1 went real well. I trust you got the data and ...</div>
<div><b>106:18:33 CC: </b>Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>106:19:52 CC: </b>Antares , Houston. We'd like you to check the WATER SEP handle and make sure it's all the way in.</div>
<div><b>106:19:59 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay, Fred, I'll get to it in just a minute.</div>
<div><b>106:20:01 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>106:21:41 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. OMNI Alfa.</div>
<div><b>106:22:21 Mitchell-LM: </b>Houston, Antares. I verified that the WATER SEP handle is all the way in.</div>
<div><b>106:22:25 CC: </b>Roger, Ed.</div>
<div><b>106:23:40 CC: </b>Okay, Antares, Houston.</div>
<div><b>106:23:47 Mitchell-LM: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>106:23:48 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. That bit just showed up again. Wonder if you could try tapping the panel there by the ABORT switch again.</div>
<div><b>106:23:59 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>106:24:20 Mitchell-LM: </b>Anything yet, Fredo?</div>
<div><b>106:24:23 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. You did good work again.</div>
<div><b>106:24:31 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>106:25:19 Mitchell-LM: </b>Houston, Antares.</div>
<div><b>106:25:24 CC: </b>Antares, Houston. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>106:25:29 Mitchell-LM: </b>Hello, Tom. Do you think we're going to come up with something on this problem with the ABORT button?</div>
<div><b>106:25:35 CC: </b>Roger. We're working it right now and also MIT's working it. Needless to say, we're busy here, but we think we got a solution.</div>
<div><b>106:25:44 Mitchell-LM: </b>Good enough. Something - is it something like a solder ball?</div>
<div><b>106:25:48 CC: </b>Well, we don't know yet. We got about 19 minutes until loss of signal here, so we'll have something to you before then, and we'll have some time to pick it up on the other side.</div>
<div><b>106:25:58 Mitchell-LM: </b>Thank you, Tom. ?</div>
<div><b>106:25:59 CC: </b>Roger. Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>106:26:08 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>106:26:09 CC: </b>Roger. Got a map update, REV 14.</div>
<div><b>106:26:19 Roosa: </b>Okay. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>106:26:20 CC: </b>Okay; 180 degrees, 107:49:38; LOS, 107:24:39-</div>
<div><b>106:26:38 Roosa: </b>Okay; 180, 107:49:38; LOS, 107:24:39-</div>
<div><b>106:26:44 CC: </b>That's affirmative. And we have an LTC photo pad, 16. Roll, 000; pitch - -</div>
<div><b>106:26:52 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>106:26:53 CC: </b>- - 303; yaw, 000; T-start, 108:37:36; T-stop, 108:47:43; range 1, 91-4; range 2, 91-1- Over.</div>
<div><b>106:27:20 Roosa: </b>Okay. LTC pad 16; 000, 303, 000; 108:37:36; 108:47:43; 91-4; 91-1- Sounds like they got the first team in down there.</div>
<div><b>106:27:38 CC: </b>Yes. We got the original CAP COMM down here today. Okay. Let me give you an LTC pad for target 12, also.</div>
<div><b>106:27:49 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>106:27:50 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>106:27:51 Roosa: </b>Stand by just 1.</div>
<div><b>106:27:55 CC: </b>Roll, 000 --</div>
<div><b>106:27:56 Roosa: </b>Okay. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>106:27:58 CC: </b>Roger. Roll, 000; pitch, 162.4; yaw, 000; T-start, 108:53:29; T-stop, 108:54:29; range, 94.1. Over.</div>
<div><b>106:28:26 Roosa: </b>Roger. 000; 108:53:29; 108:54:29; 94.1. And I've got a question on the Hycon. This morning Bruce started to give me some procedures they wanted me to troubleshoot with. He never finished, and we never got a chance to get back together again; and I think we ought to pick out a convenient time here and run over those. I've got the camera out, and, as I get a chance, I'll try to run through the procedures.</div>
<div><b>106:29:02 CC: </b>Okay. We've got that down here in a stack we've got by - back to you momentarily on it. One correction on the range; it was 94.4.</div>
<div><b>106:29:16 Roosa: </b>Okay. 94.4 - -</div>
<div><b>106:29:18 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>106:29:19 Roosa: </b>- - on LTC photo pad 12.</div>
<div><b>106:29:20 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>106:29:32 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. I tell you we're going to keep the air clear with you most of the time until LOS so we can be talking to Antares. Over.</div>
<div><b>106:29:43 Roosa: </b>Roger. I was thinking maybe if - can you bring up the other loop to talk to me on?</div>
<div><b>106:29:50 CC: </b>Yes. Okay. We're kind of busy here. We'll see about it.</div>
<div><b>106:29:57 Roosa: </b>Okay. Whatever's customary.</div>
<div><b>106:30:07 CC: </b>Antares, Houston.</div>
<div><b>106:30:13 Mitchell-LM: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>106:30:14 CC: </b>Okay, Ed, you and A1 ready to listen to some words on the abort bit business?</div>
<div><b>106:30:24 Mitchell-LM: </b>Roger. We sure are. And did you get our torquing angles?</div>
<div><b>106:30:32 CC: </b>That's affirm, Ed. Okay, Ed. And before I start in here, would you try tapping the panel again? The abort bit came back.</div>
<div><b>106:30:55 CC: </b>Okay. You tapped it right again, Ed.</div>
<div><b>106:31:02 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>106:31:03 CC: </b>Okay. I guess you've surmised already that we have some sort of a contamination in the ABORT switch. And the LMPlications of that bit being set, I guess you also realize, means that in 63 we're going to find ourselves in P70.</div>
<div><b>106:31:27 CC: </b>Okay, so - -</div>
<div><b>106:31:28 Shepard: </b>..., Fred.</div>
<div><b>106:31:30 CC: </b>Say again, Ed. How do you read me now, Ed?</div>
<div><b>106:31:38 Mitchell-LM: </b>That's affirm. We read you. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>106:31:40 CC: </b>Okay, Did you hear my last about the LMPlications of that bit being set?</div>
<div><b>106:31:48 Mitchell-LM: </b>That's affirm. We understand.</div>
<div><b>106:31:49 CC: </b>Okay. So, directly, I'll be giving you some - -</div>
<div><b>106:31:52 Shepard-LM: </b>Affirmative.</div>
<div><b>106:31:53 CC: </b>Roger, Al. I'll be giving you some changes to the time line here, whereby we'll be starting initiating PDI in PNGS, ATT HOLD, and MANUAL THROTTLE. The next consideration is if the bit sets during ullage, your procedure will be: STOP pushbutton to set and exit P63, or rather P70 in this case. And we'll have some further words on how you're to do that exit.</div>
<div><b>106:32:36 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay. We understand the strategy, I believe.</div>
<div><b>106:32:38 CC: </b>Okay. Then we - we got some more. Assuming we -we get by ignition, like you to copy the following procedures.</div>
<div><b>106:32:54 Shepard-LM: </b>Stand by 1, Fred. And, while he's getting something to write on, I understand that you're going to be looking at the - you want us to be looking at the bit during the ullage cycle?</div>
<div><b>106:33:12 CC: </b>Negative, Al. You'll get the program switched to P70, which is your cue. We'll be - we'll be looking at it down here, too, to pass the word up.</div>
<div><b>106:33:26 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay. I misunderstood you. I understand. We just go to a regular 63. Okay.</div>
<div><b>106:33:29 CC: </b>Okay. I just got corrected, Al. The switch to P70 would occur at ignition, at ignition.</div>
<div><b>106:33:40 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay. I understand.</div>
<div><b>106:33:42 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay, Fred. Do I have enough room to write just in the space on my PDI chart?</div>
<div><b>106:33:47 CC: </b>Stand by. Okay. You mean the time line, Ed, or your pad?</div>
<div><b>106:34:06 Mitchell-LM: </b>The time line.</div>
<div><b>106:34:13 CC: </b>All right, Ed - -</div>
<div><b>106:34:14 Mitchell-LM: </b>... room on the DPS burn card, Fred. Go ahead with it.</div>
<div><b>106:34:17 CC: </b>Okay. The procedure is VERB 25 NOUN 7 ENTER; 105 ENTER; 400 ENTER; 0 ENTER.</div>
<div><b>106:34:55 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. I'll read back. VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER; 05 ENTER. Is it 4000 ENTER? 0 ENTER.</div>
<div><b>106:35:08 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. It's - it's VERB 25 NOUN 7 ENTER. Then, 105 ENTER; 400, four zero zero, ENTER; 0 ENTER.</div>
<div><b>106:35:25 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER; 105 ENTER; 400 ENTER; 0 ENTER. And when do I do this?</div>
<div><b>106:35:34 CC: </b>Okay. You can do this as soon as you can after ignition. We're trying to get this into - before there's any chance of the bit getting set in this interval.</div>
<div><b>106:35:49 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. We have to let P63 call up normally, get ignition in ATT HOLD, MANUAL THROTTLE, and then reset the bit, hopefully, before it gets - or rather, lock out the bit, hopefully, before it gets set. Is that right?</div>
<div><b>106:36:03 CC: </b>That's affirm, Ed. And, if somehow you get hung up a little further downstream, you can go ahead and throttle up manually at 26. I'd like to explain the LMPlications of this. What we've done, then, is locked out P70 and P71, so any aborts have to be done on the AGS. And, while you got the card handle [sic] you can - I'll give you something that will reenable P70, P71.</div>
<div><b>106:36:36 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. We understand, and go ahead with your work.</div>
<div><b>106:36:41 CC: </b>Okay. It's VERB 25 NOUN 7 ENTER; 105 ENTER; 400 ENTER; 1 ENTER.</div>
<div><b>106:36:57 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. Readback: VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER; 105 ENTER; 400 ENTER; 1 ENTER. That's all straightforward enough.</div>
<div><b>106:37:06 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. Once we're by that initial disabling step, we got it made. We'll comment that if, in the process of your keying that in, the abort bit sets, we'll be in P70; and, if that happens, we need the same as before ignition; we'll need to stop button set and exit the program, and we'll try it on the second pass.</div>
<div><b>106:37:36 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. Are you going to give me the words on exiting now?</div>
<div><b>106:37:40 CC: </b>Okay. They're still - they're still working on that - Right. And, Antares; Houston.</div>
<div><b>106:37:58 Mitchell-LM: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>106:37:59 CC: </b>Okay. Assuming we get through the disabling procedure, after that time you can go back to AUTO on the THROTTLE and the MODE CONTROL switch.</div>
<div><b>106:38:15 Mitchell-LM: </b>Understand, Fredo. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>106:38:17 CC: </b>Okay. One other word. The same holds for any surface NO STAY. The abort there would have to be on AGS.</div>
<div><b>106:38:30 Mitchell-LM: </b>Understand, Fred.</div>
<div><b>106:38:31 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>106:38:33 Shepard-LM: </b>Roger. We understand. Sounds like you all have been busy down there.</div>
<div><b>106:39:45 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>106:39:54 Roosa: </b>...</div>
<div><b>106:39:56 CC: </b>Stu, I have some more words on the topo camera that may help a little. We've got about 5 minutes left to - to get the - these in if you're ready to discuss it.</div>
<div><b>106:40:21 Roosa: </b>Okay, Gordon. Stand by just 1. Let me copy down my COAS CAL here.</div>
<div><b>106:40:25 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>106:40:32 Roosa: </b>It'll keep. Go ahead. Tell me what I ought to do.</div>
<div><b>106:40:36 CC: </b>Okay. By way of general discussion, evidently by recreating the noise here on the ground, the only way that we can recreate the noise is by causing a DC power current limit problem to the camera. An indication on board there that this is - that would really verify that it's a DC power problem would be a flickering power-on light while - while you're getting that clacking sound. But, any rate, the consensus here is that, when the camera is making the clacking sound, you're not getting good pictures. I believe you got the - about five steps about checking the panel 227 cable, and for pin damage, and reconnecting and switching the NONESSENTIAL BUS to MAIN A. Is that correct? Did you get those steps? Over.</div>
<div><b>106:41:50 Roosa: </b>Gordon, you dropped out. Are you with me?</div>
<div><b>106:41:53 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. Where did I drop out?</div>
<div><b>106:41:59 Roosa: </b>Okay. Both from you and Bruce, all I've got is to check the pins and the connections to see if things look all right and - and that's as far as I've gotten with either one - Oh, and to switch the NONESSENTIAL power to the other BUS.</div>
<div><b>106:42:16 CC: </b>Okay. That's all we can do to try to LMProve the DC power problem. However, if you have time to verify that it's not a camera shutter being out of sequence - out of synchronization, you could shut the shutter to l/200th, and remove the magazine, and visually examine the shutter curtain inside to see that the slit in the shutter curtain is within 1 inch from one of the side rails, either side. And, at that time, examine the sprocket area from visible tears in the shutter curtain sprocket holes. After checking, if it is on one side, reinstall the magazine - and use magazine W for this - and actuate one single frame, and remove the magazine, and check that the slit is still positioned over to the side. If the slit is remaining in the center, then the camera shutter is completely out of SYNC and the camera is essentially unusable. Is that clear? Over.</div>
<div><b>106:43:42 Roosa: </b>Yes, I believe I've got that, Gordon. I'll put in magazine W, l/200th, and I guess fire a frame; remove the magazine, look at the slit, see if it's an inch from the side rail; then I guess I'll see some sprockets in there. And then if it is 1 inch, I'll put the magazine back in, fire another frame, check that the slit is still there. If it's out in the center somewhere, well then, we've got big problems.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>106:43:44 Roosa (onboard): </b>... l/200th - and, I guess, fire a frame, remove the magazine, look at the slit, see if it's an inch from the side rail - and I guess I see some sprockets in there, and then - if it is 1 inch, I'll put the magazine back in , fire another frame, and check that the slit is still there. If it's out in the center somewhere - Well, then we've got big problems.</div>
<div><b>106:44:10 CC: </b>Okay. We're just about to LOS. If this looks okay, then prepare the camera according to the normal procedures. Set the mode switch to AUTO, and do not use standby position. Just start the camera by turning the power on while the switch is in AUTO.</div>
<div><b>106:44:38 CC: </b>And, Stu, one last thing. If the clacking starts, turn the power switch off and then back on, and that may stop it.</div>
<div><b>107:08:00 : </b>BEGIN LUNAR REV 14</div>
<div><b>107:28:14 CC: </b>Antares, Houston.</div>
<div><b>107:28:19 Shepard-IM: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>107:28:20 Shepard (onboard): </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>107:28:23 CC: </b>Okay. Read you loud and clear. And we got some more procedures to pump up that are going to alter what you already copied, and Ed might ought to get something a little bigger than the DPS card to write this down.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>107:28:45 Shepard (onboard): </b>Okay, stand by. Let's get locked up on the main lobe, Fred.</div>
<div><b>107:28:45 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay, stand by. Let's get locked up on the main load first.</div>
<div><b>107:28:48 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>107:29:08 Shepard (onboard): </b>And, in the meantime, do you still read me?</div>
<div><b>107:29:08 Shepard-IM: </b>Now, in the meantime, do you still read me?</div>
<div><b>107:29:11 CC: </b>Roger, Al.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>107:29:15 Shepard (onboard): </b>Okay, ASCENT BATs went on at 108:01:45.</div>
<div><b>107:29:16 Shepard-IM: </b>Okay, ASCENT BATs went on at 108:01:45.</div>
<div><b>107:29:24 CC: </b>Roger. 108:01:45.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>107:29:33 Shepard (onboard): </b></div>
<div class="onboard"><b>107:29:35 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:29:35 Shepard-LM: </b>And NOUN 93's as follows: plus 40, minus 52, minus 16.</div>
<div><b>107:29:45 CC: </b>Okay. Copied plus 40, minus 52, and minus 16.</div>
<div><b>107:29:53 Shepard-LM: </b>That's right. ..., 107:08:30.</div>
<div><b>107:30:00 CC: </b>107:08:30.</div>
<div><b>107:30:12 CC: </b>Okay, Antares; Houston. And, before we start here, the bit is set again; could you - You still there, Antares?</div>
<div><b>107:30:46 Shepard-IM: </b>Okay, I believe we're locked up now, Houston.</div>
<div><b>107:30:53 CC: </b>Okay, Antares; Houston. If you get locked up there, you might just stay in SLEW.</div>
<div><b>107:31:04 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay, and we're locked up in AUTO TRACK, now.</div>
<div><b>107:31:08 CC: </b>Okay. I don't know if you heard, the bit appeared to be set again, and we need you to rap on the panel again by the ABORT button.</div>
<div><b>107:31:40 CC: </b>Okay, Antares. The bit is reset. And, are you still reading now?</div>
<div><b>107:31:50 Shepard-LM: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>107:31:51 CC: </b>Okay, Al. The - the reason for the - some changes I'm ... to feed you up on the procedure is, we found, in the interim of time around the backside there, a little slicker way of doing this. And what it does is allows us to start PDI in the right configuration, switchvise. And, we can make an entry before we get to ullage or ignition that will get by that problem area.</div>
<div><b>107:32:26 Shepard-LM: </b>Sounds very good. Go ahead; we're ready.</div>
<div><b>107:32:36 CC: </b>Okay. And in the interim here, Antares, could you give us P00 and DATA, so we could start getting the uplinks - in?</div>
<div><b>107:32:44 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay. You have P00 and DATA.</div>
<div><b>107:32:49 Mitchell-LM: </b>And, Fred, I am having to stay on the OMNIs. I'm ... the S-BAND ANTENNA circuit breaker.</div>
<div><b>107:32:55 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. The first is after P63 selected and you're to NOUN 92, which, in the time line, is right up - correction NOUN 62 which is right after your ENTER at minus 4 minutes.</div>
<div><b>107:33:41 CC: </b>Okay, Antares. I've got a lot of static in the background here. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>107:33:47 Mitchell-LM: </b>Loud and clear. Keep going.</div>
<div><b>107:33:49 CC: </b>Okay. After the ENTER and check DET, Ed; we need a VERB 21 NOUN 01 ENTER; 10 10 ENTER; 107 ENTER.</div>
<div><b>107:34:22 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay, Fred, I understand. After P63 is NOUN 9 -NOUN 62. At about 4 minutes, we want to ENTER VERB 21 NOUN 1; 101 ENTER; 107 ENTER.</div>
<div><b>107:34:38 CC: </b>Antares, Houston. Correction on your readback. It's VERB 21 NOUN 01 ENTER; 10 10 ENTER; 107 ENTER.</div>
<div><b>107:34:54 Mitchell-LM: </b>Roger; got you. 10 10 ENTER; 107 ENTER.</div>
<div><b>107:35:01 CC: </b>Okay, that's correct. From there on, you can follow the nominal procedures through ignition. After ignition - -</div>
<div><b>107:35:13 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:35:16 CC: </b>Okay. After ignition at plus 26 seconds on the -on page 6, we need MANUAL THROTTLE, up. And, so you don't misconstrue what I'm saying, we're - we had this AUTO switch in AUTO, but we're going to manually override it to FULL THROTTLE at 26 seconds.</div>
<div><b>107:35:39 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. We understand that at ignition plus 26, we will MANUAL THROTTLE up, overriding the AUTO.</div>
<div><b>107:35:47 CC: </b>That's correct. Okay. After we - after we get by THROTTLE UP, it's VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER; 101 ENTER; 200 ENTER; 01 ENTER. And this will enable guidance and give you steering at that time.</div>
<div><b>107:36:23 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. Understand after THROTTLE up, we ENTER VERB 25 NOUN 7; 101 ENTER; 200 ENTER; 01 ENTER. And this enables guidance steering and - at that point.</div>
<div><b>107:36:40 CC: </b>Roger. Okay the next entry. VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER; 105 ENTER; 400 ENTER; 0 ENTER.</div>
<div><b>107:37:07 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. Understand VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER; 105 ENTER; 400 ENTER; 0 ENTER. And then it looks like our procedures you gave us earlier.</div>
<div><b>107:37:18 CC: </b>That's right, Ed. This'll disable P70, P71. Okay, the next entry: VERB 21 NOUN 01 ENTER; 10 10 ENTER: 77 ENTER.</div>
<div><b>107:37:45 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. VERB 21 NOUN 01 ENTER; 10 10 ENTER; 77 ENTER.</div>
<div><b>107:37:56 CC: </b>Okay. This gets us in the P63 and the mode REG which is - gets us right for landing radar. Now, the same words apply if an abort requirement exists. We're going to be on the AGS. And one thing maybe I didn't make clear before, is the procedure for reenabling P70 - P71. You're not to perform, unless you do abort on AGS.</div>
<div><b>107:38:35 Mitchell-LM: </b>Roger. Roger. Understand that we will if - in the abort situation, we will abort on AGS and use the reenable procedure previously given up.</div>
<div><b>107:38:48 CC: </b>Okay. And the only other thing I can say is, as you already know, be sure and get MANUAL THROTTLE up at 26; and after the last entry, Ed, add one more thing; we need THROTTLE to MINIMUM setting.</div>
<div><b>107:39:10 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. Got that. The last entry we return to the COMMANDER'S THROTTLE to MINIMUM setting.</div>
<div><b>107:39:16 CC: </b>That's affirm. Antares, Houston. We'd like FORWARD OMNI.</div>
<div><b>107:39:21 Shepard-LM: </b>Hey, let me just recheck one -</div>
<div><b>107:39:27 Shepard-IM: </b>Antares. You have FORWARD OMNI.</div>
<div><b>107:39:30 CC: </b>Okay. I'm sorry I cut you out. Say again, Al.</div>
<div><b>107:39:50 CC: </b>That's affirm. And also the MODE CONTROL switch to PNGS in AUTO.</div>
<div><b>107:39:57 Shepard-LM: </b>All right, sir. Fine.</div>
<div><b>107:40:01 Mitchell-LM: </b>Fredo, we need a few words on what you want to do with this S-band. I don't think you can fight it all the way down. Can we go with the OMNI?</div>
<div><b>107:40:10 CC: </b>Stand by, Ed.</div>
<div><b>107:40:24 Mitchell-LM: </b>And, Fredo, one more question. Does this procedure, now, stay ... until such time as we get the dip aids [sic] the abort disable to feed in, or do we still need to rush right along to get that in?</div>
<div><b>107:40:39 CC: </b>Ed, this procedure is good as long as we can get by the first entry with the bit not set. That is, the entry at - right after you get NOUN 62. If you get that in with the bit not set, we're in good shape.</div>
<div><b>107:40:58 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. Is the bit not set now?</div>
<div><b>107:41:05 CC: </b>That's affirm. The bit is not set now.</div>
<div><b>107:41:11 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. And I'm standing by to switch - OMNI antenna.</div>
<div><b>107:41:40 Shepard-LM: </b>Houston, are you through with the computer?</div>
<div><b>107:41:47 CC: </b>Antares, Houston. The computer's yours.</div>
<div><b>107:41:52 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:42:13 Mitchell-LM: </b>Houston, our VOICE BACKUP is giving us a hell of a squeal.</div>
<div><b>107:42:20 CC: </b>Go ahead, Antares.</div>
<div><b>107:42:25 Mitchell-LM: </b>I say our VOICE BACKUP position of the UPDATA LINK switch is giving us quite a squeal. You ready for us to go to UPVOICE and BACKUP now?</div>
<div><b>107:42:37 CC: </b>Okay. Stand by 1, Ed.</div>
<div><b>107:42:55 CC: </b>Okay, Antares. They're configured. Now, you can try it one more time, Ed.</div>
<div><b>107:43:02 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. ...</div>
<div><b>107:43:04 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>107:43:07 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Kitty Hawk, Houston. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>107:43:28 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>107:43:34 Roosa: </b></div>
<div><b>107:43:35 CC: </b>Okay, you're way down in the mud, Stu. We're getting an awful lot of noise. We're going to drop the downlink - we're going to drop your downlink; and, if you call, call two times, so we can get it cranked back in here.</div>
<div><b>107:43:51 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:44:00 CC: </b>And - Antares; Houston.</div>
<div><b>107:44:06 Mitchell-LM: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>107:44:07 CC: </b>Okay. And, since we dropped Kitty Hawk here, we're not going to be in that relay mode for this period; so, you probably won't get an answer from him, if you call him at 2 minutes.</div>
<div><b>107:44:22 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:44:23 CC: </b>Okay. I've got your downlink.</div>
<div><b>107:44:25 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay. ... How do you read in VOX, Houston?</div>
<div><b>107:44:34 CC: </b>Okay, Al. You're about 2 by 2.</div>
<div><b>107:44:40 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. How do you read, Ed?</div>
<div><b>107:44:42 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. You're about 3 by 3 there. You're still getting a lot of background static in.</div>
<div><b>107:44:51 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay - -</div>
<div><b>107:44:52 CC: </b>Okay. Now, you're loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>107:44:53 Mitchell-LM: </b>- - Here's your VERB 83 coming up. Very good.</div>
<div><b>107:45:07 Mitchell-LM: </b>Yes, that looks good, 317, looks good; 383, that looks good. Let's go to 277, that looks good. Great. All right, I can start loading the AGS pad, now. 231, plus 56963; 6963. 240 is the same, plus 56963.</div>
<div><b>107:45:42 Shepard-LM: </b>8254.</div>
<div><b>107:45:45 Mitchell-LM: </b>8254 plus 05428.</div>
<div><b>107:45:49 Shepard-LM: </b>Right.</div>
<div><b>107:45:50 Mitchell-LM: </b>05428.</div>
<div><b>107:45:53 Shepard-LM: </b>6l, plus 00037.</div>
<div><b>107:45:57 Mitchell-LM: </b>00037, 6l, 00037 ENTER. - -</div>

<div><b>107:46:11 Mitchell-LM: </b>000147 - 62, minus 00147.</div>
<div><b>107:46:16 Shepard-LM: </b>Right. 4o4.</div>
<div><b>107:46:19 Mitchell-LM: </b>04.</div>
<div><b>107:46:21 Shepard-LM: </b>Minus 12345.</div>
<div><b>107:46:22 Mitchell-LM: </b>Minus 12345.</div>
<div><b>107:46:26 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. That's entered. Let me run back through them very quickly.</div>
<div><b>107:46:37 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:46:38 Mitchell-LM: </b>VERB ***31 read-out 56963. That's good. 240 readout, 56963. That's good. #**254 read-out - Check me on these - plus 5 - 05428.</div>
<div><b>107:46:46 Shepard-LM: </b>GO.</div>
<div><b>107:46:47 Mitchell-LM: </b>6l read-out, plus 00037.</div>
<div><b>107:46:52 Shepard-LM: </b>That looks good.</div>
<div><b>107:46:53 Mitchell-LM: </b>262 read-out, 900147.</div>
<div><b>107:46:58 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:47:00 Mitchell-LM: </b>And 4o4 is a large negative number. It's 12345.</div>
<div><b>107:47:04 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:47:06 Mitchell-LM: </b>That's good. Okay. Let's try it - -</div>
<div><b>107:47:08 Shepard-LM: </b>Anything on minus 10.</div>
<div><b>107:47:11 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. We're a little ahead of time.</div>
<div><b>107:47:15 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay. I think, Houston, what we'll do just before we enter on the final trim is to call you to see if the bit is set at that time. Do you concur?</div>
<div><b>107:47:30 CC: </b>Okay. It - it doesn't matter, Al. You can go ahead and make the enter and make the first entry at that time, after you get NOUN 62 up.</div>
<div><b>107:47:44 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay. But we seem to be fairly successful at resetting by tapping; so, if it shows prior to that time, then let us know.</div>
<div><b>107:47:51 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:48:02 Mitchell-LM: </b>Then, let me read this. At 4 minutes, that goes in, ignition plus 26 MANUAL THROTTLE.</div>
<div><b>107:48:07 Shepard-IM: </b>All right.</div>
<div><b>107:48:08 Mitchell-IM: </b>I'll put these other calls in Just as quick as I can get them in.</div>
<div><b>107:48:12 Shepard-LM: </b>Yes. One right after the other. I'll tell you what1s going on.</div>
<div><b>107:48:15 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:48:16 CC: </b>Ant are s, Houston.</div>
<div><b>107:48:20 Shepard-LM: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>107:48:21 Mitchell-LM: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>107:48:23 CC: </b>Okay. I see you're already past that point, and we need the throttle to - THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.</div>
<div><b>107:48:32 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. We're - we'll - we'll get it - when we've got it on our checklist, Fred. We're not quite there yet.</div>
<div><b>107:48:37 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. And one other thing - -</div>
<div><b>107:48:39 Mitchell-LM: </b>Go ahead and change our DPS burn?</div>
<div><b>107:48:41 CC: </b>- - the value of 231 has changed, Ed; so, we need you to reload 231 and 240 with the following number: plus 56978. That's an update to your R0S.</div>
<div><b>107:49:00 Mitchell-LM: </b>Roger. 56978, CLEAR 231; 56978, ENTER; ***40, plus 56978, ENTER. Okay, Fred. They are in.</div>

<div><b>107:49:54 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. Did you get your circuit breaker to gimbal ACT.</div>
<div><b>107:49:56 Shepard-LM: </b>Yes. They - they're all set.</div>
<div><b>107:49:58 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. Let me check mine then. ...</div>
<div><b>107:50:01 Shepard-LM: </b>I already checked yours.</div>
<div><b>107:50:02 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:50:06 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay. PGNS and PGNS AUTO and AGS AUTO. Now, push button to RESET. ...</div>
<div><b>107:50:33 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay, how far down on the DPs configuration card now down to - -</div>
<div><b>107:50:37 Shepard-IM: </b>There.</div>
<div><b>107:50:38 Mitchell-LM: </b>- - down to there. Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:50:41 Shepard-LM: </b>Through - we're through with that card.</div>
<div><b>107:50:44 Mitchell-IM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:50:46 Shepard-LM: </b>Back on this one?</div>
<div><b>107:50:47 Mitchell-LM: </b>Roger. We have 10 minutes.</div>
<div><b>107:50:48 CC: </b>Standing by for the landing radar.</div>
<div><b>107:51:17 Shepard-LM: </b>I'm a little early here.</div>
<div><b>107:51:21 Mitchell-LM: </b>Fred, if you're going to give me any words on the antenna operation, I'd appreciate them very soon.</div>
<div><b>107:51:32 CC: </b>Okay, Antares. The OMNI is GO.</div>
<div><b>107:51:38 Mitchell-IM: </b>Okay. We're going on OMNI in 10 minutes; give me circuit breaker LANDING RADAR, closed. Check the ALTITUDE TRANSMITTER.</div>
<div><b>107:51:49 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay. It's closed. And the VELOCITY TRANSMITTER is reading 4.0, and the ALTITUDE TRANSMITTER is reading 4.0.</div>
<div><b>107:51:55 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. Let's call P63.</div>
<div><b>107:51:58 Shepard-LM: </b>Let' s do.</div>
<div><b>107:52:10 Shepard-LM: </b>{Humming)</div>
<div><b>107:52:24 Mitchell-LM: </b>It looks like it's about 1 second off. Right on. Okay, timer's set. It's right on.</div>
<div><b>107:52:34 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:52:37 Mitchell-IM: </b>Okay. And we're looking for NOUN 63; go ahead.</div>

<div><b>107:53:30 Mitchell-LM: </b>Go ahead, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>107:53:31 CC: </b>Okay, somewhere down a little past 10 minutes, Ed, we're going to need to switch to AFT OMNI. We'll try to give you a call on it.</div>
<div><b>107:53:41 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay, if I hear it, I'll switch - If I hear it start to break up, I'll switch it, unless you'd rather I wait for the call.</div>
<div><b>107:53:49 CC: </b>Okay, you can go ahead and initiate it on your own, Ed. I think that'll work out better.</div>
<div><b>107:53:56 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:54:00 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay, the FDAI, GO. Ill and about -</div>
<div><b>107:54:18 Mitchell-LM: </b>Trim?</div>
<div><b>107:54:19 Shepard-LM: </b>FDAI looks good. We'll zero the CDUs.</div>

<div><b>107:55:00 Shepard-LM: </b>Get a read-out at 433, at your pleasure.</div>
<div><b>107:55:05 Mitchell-IM: </b>Okay. 433 inertial velocity.</div>
<div><b>107:55:11 Shepard-IM: </b>Okay, we're sitting on final trim, waiting 4 minutes</div>
<div><b>107:55:21 Shepard-LM: </b>Got a VERB 21 NOUN 01, 10 10 and a 107 is your first ball.</div>
<div><b>107:55:27 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. Have it there, and I've got it there. Good enough.</div>
<div><b>107:55:47 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay, we're starting now with 96 upon A and *** on B. (Cough) Real good. ...</div>
<div><b>107:56:13 Mitchell-LM: </b>Hey, A1, your RCS system looks set.</div>
<div><b>107:56:16 Shepard-LM: </b>Ascent helium 1 and 2 look good. B tanks still good. And the star track is good.</div>
<div><b>107:56:26 Mitchell-LM: </b>EPS system is good. ECS, all indications are normal</div>
<div><b>107:56:31 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:56:33 Mitchell-LM: </b>We're ready.</div>

<div><b>107:56:47 Shepard-IM: </b>A minute there.</div>
<div><b>107:56:50 Mitchell-LM: </b>All right.</div>
<div><b>107:57:06 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay. We'll go into final trim 30 seconds early. It'll allow you to get that -</div>
<div><b>107:57:11 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:57:13 Shepard-IM: </b>Then?</div>
<div><b>107:57:22 Shepard-IM: </b>Let me do the final trim, and then you can take it over.</div>
<div><b>107:57:24 Mitchell-IM: </b>Okay. Good.</div>
<div><b>107:57:28 Shepard-IM: </b>Rather have me put it in?</div>
<div><b>107:57:29 Mitchell-LM: </b>No, I've got it. I just wanted to adjust this lock - locking ... still reach.</div>
<div><b>107:57:37 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:57:39 Mitchell-LM: </b>Oh?</div>
<div><b>107:57:42 Shepard-LM: </b>...</div>
<div><b>107:57:43 Mitchell-LM: </b>Hold onto there. Do it? Says we're there, and we are.</div>
<div><b>107:57:50 Shepard-LM: </b>Hold it. Hey, are you ready?</div>
<div><b>107:57:52 Mitchell-LM: </b>I'm ready. ENTER.</div>

<div><b>107:58:10 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay, there it is.</div>
<div><b>107:58:11 Shepard-LM: </b>NOUN 62s VERB 21, NOUN 01 ENTER, 10 10, ENTER; 107, ENTER.</div>
<div><b>107:58:26 Mitchell-IM: </b>Okay, Houston. It's in.</div>
<div><b>107:58:34 CC: </b>Roger, Antares.</div>
<div><b>107:58:37 Shepard-LM: </b>And - Antares is standing by for a PDI GO.</div>
<div><b>107:58:51 CC: </b>And, Antares; Houston. You're GO for Fra Mauro.</div>
<div><b>107:58:57 Shepard-LM: </b>Good show, Fredo. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>107:59:00 Mitchell-LM: </b>Thank you. You troops do a nice job down there - -</div>
<div><b>107:59:02 Shepard-LM: </b>That was beautiful.</div>
<div><b>107:59:11 Mitchell-LM: </b>Hey, if you watch us reset, we'll flip the page.</div>
<div><b>107:59:15 Shepard-LM: </b>Let's go.</div>
<div><b>107:59:16 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:59:25 Shepard-LM: </b>.. .</div>
<div><b>107:59:27 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay. All procedures are normal from here on in except the 26. I actuate the MANUAL THROTTLE to FULL on my side.</div>
<div><b>107:59:34 Shepard-LM: </b>That's correct. I'll start reentering the DPS after you have throttled up.</div>
<div><b>107:59:39 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:59:42 Shepard-IM: </b>Won't have guidance until after I give it to you, after ... Okay.</div>
<div><b>107:59:52 Shepard-LM: </b>We covered everything on that last one?</div>
<div><b>107:59:55 Mitchell-LM: </b>Yes, sir.</div>
<div><b>108:00:00 Mitchell-LM: </b>At 10 feet per second, we ...</div>
<div><b>108:00:08 Shepard-LM: </b>You're breaking up to me. Would you run your sensitivity up a little?</div>
<div><b>108:25:00 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>108:25:05 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>108:25:07 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. We've got you on a different channel now than the LM. For some reason, we're getting a little bit of noise out of your downlink. But did you relay everything that was going on - or hear everything that was going on?</div>
<div><b>108:25:22 Roosa: </b>Yes, man. I sure did.</div>
<div><b>108:25:24 CC: </b>Okay. Mighty fine.</div>
<div><b>108:25:25 Roosa: </b>They really put her in there.</div>
<div><b>108:25:56 Roosa: </b>Hey, Ron, let me know when I can talk without disrupting things. It quieted down, now?</div>
<div><b>108:26:00 CC: </b>Yes. It's all quieted down, and your downlink's on another channel; so, no problems. So, you're clear to talk.</div>
<div><b>108:26:08 Roosa: </b>Okay. On this - Say again.</div>
<div><b>108:26:11 CC: </b>Roger. You're cleared to talk.</div>
<div><b>108:26:16 Roosa: </b>Oh, okay. Hey, that LTC camera's still acting up the same way; I tried both nonessential BUS positions, and I cycled all the connectors - could see no visi - visible damage to the pins. I did look at that slit in the shutter, and the first two times I actuated it, it stayed pretty much over 1 inch from the edge. And then, the next couple of times, it stopped about 2 inches from the edge -one each time a different edge, but out about 2 inches, maybe just a little more. It still has the clacking sound; it still wants to - intermittently fire off a frame in standby, even with the frames per minute set on zero. And I did not take the LTC photo target 16; I figured that Gordon had LMPlied that it might be a waste of film to shoot them this way; I thought maybe we could get it fixed, we could save the film. I did shoot the landing because I figured, even if it is working - that one we wouldn't have another chance at. And I fired 39 frames off of magazine B on the landing per the pad. I don't know whether it will turn out or not, because it - it clanked and fluttered the whole time.</div>
<div><b>108:27:55 CC: </b>Okay. We copy that, Stu.</div>
<div><b>108:28:01 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>108:28:06 CC: </b>One thing I might ask you there. Did you try trying the power switch ON and OFF any time when it was clicking away there.</div>
<div><b>108:28:17 Roosa: </b>Yes, I did. I cycled that. I cycled the nonessential BUS switch while it was running. Saw no change at all from MAIN A to MAIN B. And once you apply the power, it - it goes into its MAG and does its thing there, regardless of whether you have the MODE switch in AUTO, STANDBY, or SINGLE, and whether or not you turn the POWER ON and OFF again. Generally: now, when I came up to shoot the landing, when I turned the POWER switch ON a minute before the T start, it clanked all the time but didn't fire off any frames. And during the - minute plus a few seconds path there, it just kicked one, going off as it should every -one every 2 seconds. So the thing's kind of random; I can't seem to get a pattern on it.</div>
<div><b>108:29:21 CC: </b>Okay. We understand that, Stu. And it still acts like - we got the thing to foul up by a low dc voltage on the thing down here on the ground. And, like you say, if it's got the voltage up on the thing, it seems to work.</div>
<div><b>108:29:41 Roosa: </b>Hey, along that line, Gordon LMPlied that low dc voltage ought to have a flickering POWER ON light; and that's not true. Mine appears to be steady.</div>
<div><b>108:29:50 CC: </b>Okay. I copied. And, Stu, I've got a bunch of P24 pads here for you. Better start copying them, I guess. And also - -</div>
<div><b>108:29:59 Roosa: </b>Okay. Hey, let me fire off this 52, and then I'll be right with you.</div>
<div><b>108:30:02 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>108:32:15 Roosa: </b>Okay. Ron, let's go to work on the pads.</div>
<div><b>108:32:18 CC: </b>Okay. How about trying for the HIGH GAIN, MANUAL and MEDIUM, PITCH of minus of 73, YAW of 11.</div>
<div><b>108:32:51 CC: </b>And Kitty Hawk; Houston. When you get it, start with RP-3 on page 13.</div>
<div><b>108:33:04 Roosa: </b>Okay. I've got you now. Can you read me, Ron; the signal strength doesn't look too good.</div>
<div><b>108:33:08 CC: </b>Okay. The yaw - try a yaw of 25 degree.</div>
<div><b>108:33:21 CC: </b>Okay. You still with me, Stu?</div>
<div><b>108:33:27 Roosa: </b>Yes, I've still got you here. Yaw 25's a little too much. Let me play with it just a second.</div>
<div><b>108:33:50 Roosa: </b>Okay, Ron.- That looks like about the best I'm going to do. That good enough for you?</div>
<div><b>108:33:53 CC: </b>Okay. I think it looks pretty good down here, now. And ready to start on RP-3. Still got about 9 minutes, yet. Okay, T , 109:57:54; T^, 110:02:44; 110:04:24; 110:05:12; north 5 and - -</div>
<div><b>108:34:37 Roosa: </b>Okay. RP-3, 109:57:54. Go ahead, Ron. Let's run them all through, and then I'll read them back.</div>
<div><b>108:34:47 CC: </b>Okay, good. RP-5: T1, 110:08:45, 110:13=35; 110 :15 :15 ; HO: 16 :03. It's on track. Okay. The Daguerre 66. T1, 110:30:11; 110 - -</div>
<div><b>108:35:37 Roosa: </b>Hold it. Start Daguerre over again. You broke up.</div>
<div><b>108:35:41 CC: </b>Roger. Okay, the Daguerre 66 T1 is 110:30:11; 110:35:01; 110:36:41; 110:37:29. It's north 22. Okay, ready for P20 - Landmark 14-1.</div>
<div><b>108:36:26 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>108:36:27 CC: </b>T1 is 110:46:15; 110:51:05; 110:52:45; 110:53:33. It's north 6, and, of course, it'll be 14-1 for the NOUN 89.</div>
<div><b>108:37:02 Roosa: </b>Okay, Ron. You broke up on TCA and T3.</div>
<div><b>108:37:08 CC: </b>Okay. TCA on 14-1, 110:52:45; T3, 110:53:33. North 6; NOUN 89 is 14-1.</div>
<div><b>108:37:33 Roosa: </b>Okay. 14-1, 110:46:15; 110:51:05; 110:52:45; 110:53:33; north 6, 14-1.</div>
<div><b>108:37:50 CC: </b>Roger. Readback correct.</div>
<div><b>108:38:02 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Request P00 and ACCEPT there, and we'll give you a state vector.</div>
<div><b>108:38:12 Roosa: </b>Okay. You have it.</div>
<div><b>108:38:32 CC: </b>And, Kitty Hawk; Houston. Got a map update for the REV 15 on page 13.</div>
<div><b>108:38:40 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>108:38:41 CC: </b>Roger. 180 degrees is 109:47:59.</div>
<div><b>108:38:50 Roosa: </b>109:47:59.</div>
<div><b>108:38:54 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>108:40:59 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Computer's yours, now.</div>
<div><b>108:41:06 Roosa: </b>Okay. Thank you, Ron.</div>
<div><b>108:42:11 CC: </b>Okay. Kitty Hawk, Houston. About 45 seconds to LOS; we'll see you on the other side.</div>
<div><b>108:42:19 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>109:07:00 : </b>BEGIN LUNAR REV 15</div>
<div><b>109:32:25 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. About time to start the camera on RP-5 ? e</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>109:38:11 Roosa (onboard): </b>Houston, 14, How do you read? ...</div>
<div><b>109:38:11 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>109:38:15 CC: </b>Roger. Loud and clear, Stu.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>109:38:30 Roosa (onboard): </b>Well, how're the troops of Antares making out? Do you have an estimate on the landing spot yet, Ren?</div>
<div><b>109:38:30 Roosa: </b>Well, how are the troops in Antares maiing out? Do we have an estimate on the landing spot yet, Don?</div>
<div><b>109:38:39 CC: </b>Okay. They're pressing on with all their checks down there. And everything is still real good. They've got a STAY.</div>
<div><b>109:38:46 Roosa: </b>Real good.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>109:38:51 Roosa (onboard): </b>How far from the spot? Did they - they come right in on the first pick?</div>
<div><b>109:38:53 Roosa: </b>How far from the spot? Did they come right in on the first pick?</div>
<div><b>109:38:59 CC: </b>Say again, Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>109:39:05 Roosa (onboard): </b>Roger. Are they right on the target?</div>
<div><b>109:39:05 Roosa: </b>Roger. Are they right on the target?</div>
<div><b>109:39:09 CC: </b>Yes, I think so. From what we can tell they just passed over the north crater of Triplet, and on down the stream just a little bit, but Just a little bit short of the target, I think, initially. They haven't started the - their descriptions yet, though. I haven't gotten the word yet on exactly where they are.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>109:39:26 Roosa (onboard): </b>Oh, okay.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>109:43:41 Roosa (onboard): </b>Houston, 14 - Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>109:43:41 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14 or Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>109:43:45 CC.: </b>Roger. Go ahead, Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>109:43:51 Roosa (onboard): </b>Hey, Ron, got any word on how the low-altitude pass on 11-1 and the high-altitude compare?</div>
<div><b>109:43:51 Roosa: </b>Hey, Ron, got any word on how the low altitude track on 14-1 and high altitude, compare?</div>
<div><b>109:44:05 CC: </b>Let me see if I can get that, Stu.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>109:44:11 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>109:44:11 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>109:44:36 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>109:47:59 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>109:48:04 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, big ...</div>
<div><b>109:48:06 CC: </b>Roger. You're kind of down in the mud, Stu. But your high altitude tracking was excellent, and we've changed the landing site from a previous estimate there, 1400 feet in latitude, and zero in longitude. We've only got three real-time marks on the low altitude, but it compares real favorably with the high altitude stuff, so far.</div>
<div><b>109:48:37 Roosa: </b>Well, now the other marks, on the low altitude, Ron, on the - on the tape, that right?</div>
<div><b>109:48:42 CC: </b>Yes. That affirm. They were on the tape, and it took us awhile to get that dumped on the tape, and then - so we're just now getting the tape data.</div>
<div><b>109:48:54 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>109:49:39 CC: </b>And, Kitty Hawk; Houston. You've got about 30 seconds to T1 time for Daguerre 66.</div>
<div><b>109:49:48 Roosa: </b>Okay. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>109:54:01 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. You can start your camera.</div>
<div><b>109:54:07 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>110:05:51 CC: </b>Okay, Stu; Houston here. You're coming up on the T1 time.</div>
<div><b>110:06:00 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>110:10:04 CC: </b>Okay. Time to start your camera there, Stu.</div>
<div><b>110:10:10 Roosa: </b>Ron, she's running; thank you.</div>
<div><b>110:10:14 CC: </b>Okay. And when you finish up there as you?re -whipping on across the landing site, those guys are so close to it, you probably can?t tell the difference from up there.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>110:14:04 Roosa (onboard): </b>All right, Ron. I tried to change the camera and put the sextant on and take a look at the site.</div>
<div><b>110:14:06 Roosa: </b>Ron, I tried to change the camera and put the sextant on and take a look at - the site; Cone Crater went by just as I got the sextant up.</div>
<div><b>110:14:20 CC: </b>Okay. Couldn't understand what you said that time, Stu. Just for your information though, Antares is locked onto you with her radar.</div>
<div><b>110:14:32 Roosa: </b>Okay. What I said was, that soon as I finished up on 14-1, I tried to get the sextant in, in time to look at the LM; but, by the time I got it in, Cone Crater was just passing out of the field of view.</div>
<div><b>110:14:47 CC: </b>Roger. I understand. We'll catch them one of these other REVs.</div>
<div><b>110:14:55 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>110:20:27 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>110:20:33 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston; Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>110:20:35 CC: </b>Roger. We'll stand by for the magazine percentage there after - on the landmark tracking magazine.</div>
<div><b>110:20:57 Roosa: </b>Okay. I saw it 62 percent.</div>
<div><b>110:21:03 CC: </b>Roger. Sixty-two percent?</div>
<div><b>110:21:11 Roosa: </b>Yes. That's what it looks like.</div>
<div><b>110:21:13 CC: </b>Okay. And once you get in attitude, we'll use this high gain procedures: MANUAL and MEDIUM BEAM width.</div>
<div><b>110:21:27 Roosa: </b>All right.</div>
<div><b>110:22:18 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Request OMNI Alfa until we get into the attitude.</div>
<div><b>110:22:26 Roosa: </b>How do you read, Houston? Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>110:22:30 CC: </b>Roger, Kitty Hawk; loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>110:22:37 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>110:28:47 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. I've got some map updates, and your zero phase pads for you.</div>
<div><b>110:28:57 Roosa: </b>Okay. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>110:28:59 CC: </b>Okay. On page 16, there. Map update, REV 16; 180 is 111:46:20.</div>
<div><b>110:29:15 Roosa: </b>Okay, 111:46:20.</div>
<div><b>110:29:19 CC: </b>Okay, your zero phase pad to backward.</div>

<div><b>110:39:45 Roosa: </b>Okay, got Charlie Quebec 0.5 and 65.4. And we'll get the gegenschein. This new window shade sure looks great, Ron. And fits on - back on the camera real good. Just to be doubly safe, I just got through taping floodlight - right up by the window.</div>
<div><b>110:40:06 CC: </b>Hey, beautiful.</div>

<div><b>111:06:00 : </b>BEGIN LUNAR REV 16</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:15:35 Roosa (onboard): </b>Left, left, and .. .</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:18:31 Roosa (onboard): </b>That son of a bitch.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:21:43 Roosa (onboard): </b>Oks.y, we're getting ready to start the zero-phase observations on target 1. I'm now running - DET was started at - T-start at 111:59:43 and I'm waiting to try again.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:22:20 Roosa (onboard): </b>First target at 8:07.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:23:26 Roosa (onboard): </b>... 5.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:23:43 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, starting at 9:05.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:23:58 Roosa (onboard): </b>... yet. If not ... -</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:24:29 Roosa (onboard): </b>And approaching 4 minutes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:25:02 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, there are my targets. Targets A, B, C.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:25:26 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, standing by to start the time. That's 5 minutes.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:25:43 Roosa (onboard): </b>MARK, Intervalometer going. Okay, I have targets A, B, and C. C will be the first into the zero-phase. Picked them up without any difficulty at all.... anyway. Intervalometer ... again.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:26:14 Roosa (onboard): </b>And A, B - Okay, looks like C is Just about ir. zero-phase now. And I really have lost C at zero-phase. That's a pretty good picture there. As it moved into zero-phase, it was essentially wiped out.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:26:33 Roosa (onboard): </b>Now it's coming back out again.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:26:46 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, B. You just almost lose B going to zero-phase. I can tell where it is by the other craters -pointing at it. But, if you didn't have that help, it'd be tough.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:27:12 Roosa (onboard): </b>And now we're going into - A's going ir. toward zero-phase. In fact, I'm quite surprised how washed out they do become. I had anticipated I would be able to stay with them a little more than that.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:27:33 Roosa (onboard): </b>Well, we're going - It's 7 minutes, so A will be moving towards zero-phase. And it's pretty much the same story. Zero-phase is that - is that condition - it - it really - Kind of surprising how it - how it wipes it out, I think you can tell the general area, on B in particular, that with the lead-in, you could - you could find it. With -with B, it's pretty much totally wiped out at -at zero-phase, and A had a little better landmarks around it.</div>
<div><b>111:27:54 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. You ought to be switching to your second target.</div>
<div><b>111:28:15 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. You ought to be switching to your second target.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:28:25 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, I'm switching to second target new. .And A shows up extremely well. B is - you can see 3 here now. It's just starting to go into - into zero-phase as it moves on up. But B is a - 3's a mighty rough target, even without zero-phase,</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:29:09 Roosa (onboard): </b>And you can - you can hang onto A pretty well. B - B, just - I just didn't find long enough to give a good - a good impression on that one - on that one, I guess, overall, I'd rate it - at -</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:29:47 Roosa (onboard): </b>But A in - in target 2, you can almost hang onto B in target 1 -</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:30:08 Roosa (onboard): </b>Now, of course, target 2-B is hard to find even under good conditions, so - but it'd be impossible at the - at the zero-phase point. And I'm going to quit now, and I'll give you a little summary here. I'll rate these as I - by the criteria that we set up. Okay, on target 1, I'd rate C -</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:30:45 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, I'm going to turn off the intervalometer. No. Let it run for another 20 seconds. But I - I'm so far out, I - I really can't - It says you got to let the DAC run until 12:24. Okay. All right, I'd rate - I'd rate C in area 1 - I'd rate C as low; B as medium, and A is - is low; 2-A, medium; and B, very low.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:31:52 Roosa (onboard): </b>I think what would really help you is - is relief around, like C was out pretty flat. And then, when It got zero-phase, it pretty well wiped it out. But - okay, and on my mark, the DAC will be going off. Stand by.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:32:11 Roosa (onboard): </b>MARK. I let it slip one.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:32:13 Roosa (onboard): </b>MARK. There, that was the last picture on targets 1 and 2,</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:32:21 Roosa (onboard): </b>And just a little more on the debriefing, I think if there's some relief around, it helps you quite a bit. Like C was out flat, and you'd lose it. B, I had the good chain of craters going into it, so you could pick that up, and - and A, also. It was the landmarks that really - really had you pick it up. But when it's out flat, it just washed it out completely.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:33:08 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, Houston, Kitty Hawk,</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:33:59 Roosa (onboard): </b>344.7, 340.9, ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:34:17 Roosa (onboard): </b>Hello, Houston. This is Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>111:36:55 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:36:57 Roosa (onboard): </b>Kitty Hawk. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>111:36:57 Roosa: </b>Kitty Hawk. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>111:36:58 CC: </b>Okay, I got you now. How was good old target 2, there?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:37:07 Roosa (onboard): </b>Well ... I never saw B at all, and A ... pick up ... zero-phase, B was just completely wiped out.... clue is ... some relief by you, even in zero-phase ... best of the three . . , pretty well hang ... and A was about ...</div>
<div><b>111:37:07 Roosa: </b>Well, I'm afraid you're right, Ron. It was pretty tough, I never saw B at all and A - I think - is pretty far down. I was pretty surprised at target 1, generally, the targets, A, B, and C are very easy to pick up; but in zero phase, B was Just completely wiped out. I think the clue is heading down the flat - if you have got some relief by you, even in zero phase, you know, you can sort of use that as - to help you on in. But in zero phase, B was pretty well bombed out. D was actually the best of the three and if you can pretty well hang on in, you can pick it up, if you use the other craters as a lead in and A was about - he was -... and during zero phase that whole ... really washed out.</div>
<div><b>111:38:21 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. We are getting too much background noise here. I really couldn't understand anything you said there.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:38:31 Roosa (onboard): </b>Well ...</div>
<div><b>111:38:31 Roosa: </b>Well, why didn't you stop me? Okay ? get it all on the tape - I'll put this other ... on the tape, also then. Well, I guess it'll have to be running. Are you going to leave the tape running during this next ...?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:38:38 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay ... on the tape ... this other ...</div>
<div><b>111:39:04 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Why don't you go ahead and leave the tape running here. We sure can't make out what you're saying down here.</div>
<div><b>111:40:39 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk. Houston here. We took the ... out; maybe we ought to get rid of some of the banging. How do you hear me now?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:40:50 Roosa (onboard): </b>... loud and clear ...?</div>
<div><b>111:40:50 Roosa: </b>Oh, you're loud and clear. What did you take out?</div>
<div><b>111:40:53 CC: </b>Well, something that's supposed to cut out part of the static. It does cut down on the static, but everytime the signal strength gets a little bit low, it also bangs. So, I couldn't hear you. I took those out and now I can hear you loud and clear.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:41:09 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, you've always been loud and clear ...</div>
<div><b>111:41:09 Roosa: </b>Okay, you've always been loud and clear here. No problem at all.</div>
<div><b>111:41:13 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:41:30 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, Ron; are you going to let the tape run for the ... next sighting?</div>
<div><b>111:41:30 Roosa: </b>Okay, Ron; are you going to let the tape run for these - during this next sighting?</div>
<div><b>111:43:19 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk. Houston.</div>
<div><b>111:43:25 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Ron.</div>
<div><b>111:43:26 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. The comm is a little bit marginal down here, but what we would like to do is leave the tape running until after this next zero phase, but also talk to the ground if you will and then maybe we will have some comments back for you. And then we should get it in one place or the other for sure.</div>
<div><b>111:43:47 Roosa: </b>Okay, very good.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:46:55 Roosa (onboard): </b>And, Houston; Kitty Hawk, Do you want me to terminate the charge on B and start one on Able?</div>
<div><b>111:46:56 Roosa: </b>And Houston, Kitty Hawk. You want me to terminate the charge on B and start one on Able?</div>
<div><b>111:47:05 CC: </b>That's affirmative, Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:47:10 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>111:47:11 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>111:55:29 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. You've got about 30 seconds to start time.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>111:55:36 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, thank you.</div>
<div><b>111:55:36 Roosa: </b>Okay, thank you.</div>
<div><b>112:00:25 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. About 30 seconds to turn the camera on. Give me a hack when you turn it on.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:00:36 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, I'll do that.</div>
<div><b>112:00:36 Roosa: </b>Okay, I'll do that.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:00:56 Roosa (onboard): </b>And stand by.</div>
<div><b>112:00:57 Roosa: </b>And stand by.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:00:59 Roosa (onboard): </b>MARK. Camera's running. Five minutes. Okay, and now I can pick up to Ptolemaeus, to Ptolemaeus A, and I can pick up Bright Crater. Yes, even at this low elevation, targets A and B show up real well. The trouble of it is, it doesn't look to me like the camera's on target, but - They're a little too far to the left. But, anyway, I can't see targets -both targets A and B by themselves. I guess I used that little bright crater up by B, maybe as a gouge, but it showed up pretty well. There's no problem on acquisition, Houston. Appear to just be getting better as I - as I come up in elevation. Of course, I guess it wouldn't surprise me to come up cere and see that I picked up the wrong target.</div>
<div><b>112:01:00 Roosa: </b>MARK. Camera's running ...</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:02:18 Roosa (onboard): </b>I really don't think this camera's pointed right, Ron. It's boresighted right down - looks like the junction between Ptolemaeus and Alphonsus. But, anyway, my - both targets A and B - had no trouble acquiring these and no trouble sticking with them. Even A is the - the hardest; it's not quite as straight, Now B had a - had a bright rim and showed up at the very start of the - of the observation. A is - is a little more subdued, but it was quite easy to pick up and hang on to. And that's - that's really a no-sweat on - on this one, much - much easier than the - those on the backside. In fact, I rated some of those with zero. And I'd have to give them up on - on both these targets - Cone Crater.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:03:34 Roosa (onboard): </b>And the hard part is over, once you acquire them at that low elevation. In fact, the elevation is as difficult as - any sort of Sun problem, That would be here, as we go - go towards the zero-phase; I guess it's probably still about 08:40 and I'd guess about 40 minutes to go. It's still hanging in there right now. No - no problem at all. Particularly B, it's - it hasn't the - the bright surface on the center across the crater -that makes it that much easier. Let's see, I can see the zero-phase. And I guess the camera was pointing at it as we get up here closer. And I can see zero-phase now, approaching target A, so this should be a - a good test. Been no problem to acquire up to now.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:04:39 Roosa (onboard): </b>There's zero-phase just about on A, and the camera took the picture. Okay, we went through zero-phase on A with - with no problem - hanging on to the landmark itself.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:04:56 Roosa (onboard): </b>Zero-phase is passing B - at this time. And it, again, is definitely no problem.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:05:12 Roosa (onboard): </b>And now, as we come cut of the - out of the zero-phase, it gets constantly better, of course. And I'll be switching targets at 09:58. It's 09:24 now. Both targets at Ptolemaeus are ready to pick up. Of course, it's no problem now picking those up.</div>
<div><b>112:05:55 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston. You can start on STOP on that one, and switch to target area 4. We can't hear a thing you're saying down here, but keep talking - We'll get it on the tape.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:05:59 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, we're going to switch now and take a look at - at Parry. And - actually, this one here is again extremely easy. You can pick up both -both targets A and B as soon as you see it, r.c sweat. I think you'd use the - of course, you'd use the - Parry and Parry M to guide you into the area. But once you got into the area, why. A and B just stand out so good that, here again, it's -primarily - it's - the elevation angle helps, because we're up a little higher and - and, also, the bright crater stages show up extremely well. It's like you got the crater with a bright rim. It really helps with low elevation.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:07:08 Roosa (onboard): </b>In fact, zero-phase is approaching - approaching the area now. And both targets are - are hanging in there .</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:07:22 CiIF (onboard): </b>Camera went just right at zero-phase. And here again, it was extremely easy to recognize the targets - this would be - really, again, a nosweat proposition to pick the targets up. Zero-phase - really doesn't have that big an effect on -on these two targets.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:08:10 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay. And now, I'll stop and rate them here; seems like a good time, I guess target A was extremely good all the way along. Target B, also, was quite easy to recognize. But here again, prim - primarily because of the - of the Sun shining on the - on the crater rim. An older, more diffuse crater would be more difficult to pick up, but with those -with those bright - bright rims - bright side to -both targets A and B, it was really no problem. Okay, And my last picture, I will give you a mark. When it goes off, it'll be a little past 12:32.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:09:21 Roosa (onboard): </b>And -</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:09:22 Roosa (onboard): </b>MARK. Last picture on target 4, Camera is off.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:11:11 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay. I'll get to moving here, and then I'll pick me up at - oh, maybe between 50 and 58. First frame number should be eight.</div>
<div><b>112:12:39 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Will you try to pass down the frame number off of the zero phase stuff?</div>
<div><b>112:12:48 Roosa: </b>Okay. Frame number is 58.</div>
<div><b>112:12:52 CC: </b>Say it again.</div>
<div><b>112:12:58 Roosa: </b>Frame number is 58.</div>
<div><b>112:13:02 CC: </b>Roger. Understand 58.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:13:42 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay. Just a couple of more comments while they're fresh in my mind. I think there was a big difference between the frontside and the backside passes , and that's primarily because, on the - on the front side, we're picking out craters that were out in a flat area. And they had the rim up behind them to - to guide you in on it. I think you'd - you'd use the - the large, gross features to get you pointed in the right area of the - of the mare or the flat surface, and - and then, the - the rim of the crater would - would - would show up. And you could guide in on it. Both those craters at Parry were quite fresh; they had a bright rim, The target A in the Ptolemaeus was fairly subdued - but still, yet, it did show up, and you could hold on to it right through zero-phase. So, let me see, I' c. rate -</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>112:15:16 Roosa (onboard): </b>I'c. rate both - both targets 3 and 4 - high.</div>
<div><b>112:15:43 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. I've got your map update for REV IT and the zodiacal light photo pad.</div>
<div><b>112:15:48 Roosa: </b>Stand by just 1, Ron.</div>
<div><b>112:17:14 Roosa: </b>Okay, Ron; go ahead.</div>
<div><b>112:17:21 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. Again, I could just barely read you; but your map update for REV IT: 180, 113:44:40.</div>
<div><b>112:17:32 Roosa: </b>Okay; 113:44:40.</div>
<div><b>112:17:35 CC: </b>Roger, that's correct. Okay, zodiacal light photo pad T-start, 113:18:03.</div>
<div><b>112:17:51 Roosa: </b>Okay, 113:18:03, zodiacal light T-start.</div>
<div><b>112:17:57 CC: </b>Roger; that's correct.</div>
<div><b>112:18:03 Roosa: </b>I guess our comm didn't hold out through that, did it, Ron? Seemed like I heard you - heard it drop out.</div>
<div><b>112:29:59 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>112:30:05 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston; Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>112:30:07 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. As you know, when you come around the other side here, we?re going to want to dump the DSE to get your zero-phase stuff. So, if you'll come over the hill in these attitudes - You ready to copy?</div>
<div><b>112:30:26 Roosa: </b>Okay, stand by. Hey, I noticed the a - the tape was barber-poled. I don't know if it went during the second - or not - zero phase; did you stop the tape after the second zero-phase pass?</div>
<div><b>112:30:39 CC: </b>That's affirm; we stopped it and rewound it.</div>
<div><b>112:30:46 Roosa: </b>Okay, that's what I was afraid of. I was afraid it might have run down - okay, thank you. Give me some attitudes.</div>
<div><b>112:30:51 CC: </b>Okay. Roll, 060; pitch of 304, yaw of 0. Your HIGH GAIN angles will be PITCH, plus 33; YAW of 279. And you can start the maneuver to that attitude after you complete your zodiacal light stuff.</div>
<div><b>112:31:24 Roosa: </b>Okay, I'll start a maneuver after the zodiacal light of 060, 304, 000. Set up the HIGH GAIN on a PITCH of plus 33, YAW of 279-</div>
<div><b>112:31:37 CC: </b>Roger; and, as you can know, that's just 60 degrees out and roll from the LM visual attitude.</div>
<div><b>112:31:48 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>112:32:16 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>112:32:17 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>112:32:18 CC: </b>Okay, Stu; I gave you some bum dope there. We just stopped the tape at the end of the zero-phase stuff; we did not rewind it, so you can go ahead and use it on the back side.</div>
<div><b>112:32:32 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>112:32:45 CC: </b>Your comm's good now; I don't know why it wasn't real good there during zero phase.</div>
<div><b>112:32:54 Roosa: </b>Yes; well, I got you on the HIGH GAIN now.</div>
<div><b>112:32:57 CC: </b>Oh, okay; that's why (laughter).</div>
<div><b>112:33:04 Roosa: </b>Yes, it does help.</div>
<div><b>112:34:28 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Just for your information, EVA preparation seems to be progressing normally down there at the Fra Mauro area. And they'll probably be out on the surface when you come around the other side.</div>
<div><b>112:34:45 Roosa: </b>Ah, very good. Did they say anything about the terrain, Ron? It seems like I heard them say they were - something like an 8-degree roll angle or something.</div>
<div><b>112:35:04 CC: </b>Yes, that's right. And it's a little rougher than what they thought it was going to be down there. That was just a general comment on the terrain.</div>
<div><b>112:35:19 Roosa: </b>They comment on how steep it looked - to get up the Cone?</div>
<div><b>112:35:38 CC: </b>Hey, Stu; Cone's about 5 o?clock, and they really weren't looking at the slope as they came down across there (laughter).</div>
<div><b>112:35:51 Roosa: </b>Oh, that's right. Yes, sorry about that.</div>
<div><b>112:35:55 CC: </b>No sweat.</div>
<div><b>112:35:58 Roosa: </b>I already had them outside.</div>

<div><b>113:27:03 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston. We got you loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>113:27:09 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>113:27:15 CC: </b>And, Stu, I guess we may as well start off with the P24 landmark tracking pad, there, on page 21. And, let me ask you a question here. If the - th hours are the same in all these T^, T^, TCAs, and T^, how about just reading the hour on the T^ and read minutes and seconds on the rest of them. Is that okay?</div>
<div><b>113:27:40 Roosa: </b>That sounds like a great idea.</div>
<div><b>113:27:42 CC: </b>Okay. Good.</div>
<div><b>113:29:34 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>113:29:35 Roosa: </b>Houston, how do you read Kitty Hawk?</div>
<div><b>113:29:37 CC: </b>Okay. Loud and clear there. Now, Stu, how about that P00 and ACCEPT here, and we'll ship you a state vector. And whenever you're ready to copy on the LM visual pad.</div>
<div><b>113:29:52 Roosa: </b>Okay. You have P00 and ACCEPT, and I'm ready to copy.</div>
<div><b>113:29:54 CC: </b>Okay. T , 114:43:27; 48:27, 49:57, 50:11; north 12 miles. Okay for your latitude - it'll be a minus 03.651; longitude over 2, minus 08.734. And you can make a little note down there for the site map. The coordinates - latest ones, are CQ 0.1 and 65.4, that's Charlie Quebec 0.1.</div>
<div><b>113:31:07 Roosa: </b>Okay. Copy 114:43:27, 48:27, 49:57, 50:11; north 12; latitude, minus 03.651; longitude over 2, minus 08.734, and, I guess, we'll call the altitude 000.76.</div>
<div><b>113:31:34 CC: </b>That's affirm. And, Kitty Hawk; Houston, the computer is yours. And, Stu, I'm going to - -</div>
<div><b>113:31:48 Roosa: </b>Okay. The computer's mine and - Go ahead, Ron.</div>
<div><b>113:31:55 CC: </b>Okay. If you want to take these down here, I'm going to give you some magazine - numbers here that I want to make sure we save. Since we're having a couple of problems here with our Hycon, we would like to save magazine Tango. That's the MBW film as a backup to magazine Papa. And the magazine Papa is the prime 500-millimeter magazine. And now, if you've already used something out of magazine Tango, we'd just like to know what percentages are still on the magazine, or what the frame numbers are?</div>
<div><b>113:32:49 Roosa: </b>That doesn't sound familiar. I'll have to go back through here and check it. The only ones I've used are those that we've listed here. So far, I've been following them right down the line.</div>
<div><b>113:33:01 CC: </b>Okay. Sounds like we're in pretty good shape. I think magazine Tango is the one that - was - you know, opportunity-type photos.</div>
<div><b>113:33:13 Roosa: </b>Yes. I haven't taken any of those.</div>
<div><b>113:33:16 CC: </b>Okay. Real good.. And just as a - a note, we're not sure - for sure yet, but we'll probably do a COAS pass on Descartes on REV 25. And then, when they get on around to the Hycon passes, we'll probably try to - to get that thing to work as we're going for REV 27 and whenever the other one is.</div>
<div><b>113:33:41 CC: </b>And, Stu, to keep you up to date on what's happening down there on the surface, they had a little bit of comm problems with the PLSSs and the relays and all those good-deal things like that. And they're running a little bit behind, but it looks like they'll make it out, probably in about 20 or 30 minutes.</div>
<div><b>113:36:12 CC: </b>And, Kitty Hawk; Houston. Do you remember - remember what the percentage of magazine left for the zodiacal light?</div>
<div><b>113:36:29 Roosa: </b>Roger, Houston. I call that 72 percent.</div>
<div><b>113:36:35 CC: </b>Mighty fine, Stu. 72 percent.</div>
<div><b>113:40:08 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>113:40:13 Roosa: </b>Go, Houston.</div>
<div><b>113:40:15 CC: </b>Okay, we've got a good tape dump, and you can proceed to the LM visual attitude at your convenience.</div>
<div><b>113:40:26 Roosa: </b>Okay. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>113:51:39 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Big Al's on the surface.</div>
<div><b>113:54:32 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>113:54:40 CC: </b>And Kitty Hawk, Houston. Kind of translating in the blind. Ed's out on the surface now with Al, And I think we got a good uplink, but downlink is pretty weak. So, don't answer if you can't read anything.</div>
<div><b>114:00:58 Roosa: </b>Houston, Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>114:01:24 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. You're very weak. Say again.</div>
<div><b>114:01:52 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. In the blind, about 30 seconds from T^ time.</div>
<div><b>114:02:03 Roosa: </b>Houston, are you calling Kitty Hawk?</div>
<div><b>114:02:06 CC: </b>Hey, by golly; I read you, Stu. Yes, you are coming up time.</div>
<div><b>114:03:45 Roosa: </b>You are unreadable. Pick another comm track ...</div>

<div><b>114:19:43 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston; Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>114:19:45 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. I've got a bunch of P24 pads here, if you're ready to start copying. Starting on page 22 with RP-2.</div>
<div><b>114:19:54 Roosa: </b>Okay, just a word about the - Okay, before you start those, I got a track on the - on the LM. I noticed as I came back up, the - the tape motion had gone barber pole, though; I hope it was running. I checked it just before I started marking. Or maybe you stopped it. I don't know. But I would put the LM on those coordinates at Charlie Quebec 0.0 and 65-1.</div>
<div><b>114:20:31 CC: </b>And you saw the LM at Charlie Quebec 0.0 and 65.1. Is that correct?</div>
<div><b>114:20:45 Roosa: </b>Yes, that's where I - I would put it on the map. It looks like that's where I was tracking it. It looked like it was just a little - you know, you'd - you'd plotted it down just off the edge of that old crater in Triplet, and I've got it over on the other side of it.</div>
<div><b>114:20:59 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>114:21:13 CC: </b>I guess you got the word - they're out on the surface now - don't you?</div>
<div><b>114:21:19 Roosa: </b>I heard Bruce talk something about the contingency sample, so I figured they made it.</div>
<div><b>114:21:29 CC: </b>Okay. And, if you are ready to copy here, we'll press on with some of these P24 pads.</div>
<div><b>114:21:37 Roosa: </b>Okay, I'm ready to go.</div>

<div><b>116:33:29 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>116:34:03 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Kind of in the blind here. Just a reminder to terminate your battery charge prior to the plane change burn.</div>
<div><b>116:35:01 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. About 1 minute until LOS. We?ll see you coining around the other side, and A1 and Ed are about 3 hours into their EVA, whipping away on their ALSEP deployment.</div>
<div><b>116:35:18 Roosa: </b>I didn't get all of that, Ron. But I did get they?re in the ALSEP deployment. Is that affirm?</div>
<div><b>116:35:24 CC: </b>That?s affirm, about 30 seconds. And did you get: terminate your battery charge prior to burn?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>116:35:34 Roosa (onboard): </b>No, I didn't get that yet. Do you want to let it run on through until I come out AOS, or do you want - When do you want that terminated?</div>
<div><b>116:35:34 Roosa: </b>No, I didn't get that yet. Do you want to let it run on through until I come out AOS, or do you want that terminated?</div>
<div><b>116:35:44 CC: </b>No, do it sometime prior to the burn.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>116:35:49 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>116:35:50 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>

<div><b>117:23:17 Roosa: </b>Okay, I'm coming up on my pitch 4-minute mark. Everything's completed on the checklist up to that.</div>
<div><b>117:23:26 CC: </b>Okay, mighty fine, Stu. As soon as we get a little HIGH BIT RATE here, we?ll take a good look at your data.</div>
<div><b>117:23:53 Roosa: </b>And, Ron, do you want me to do anything with the tape recorder; you going to handle that?</div>
<div><b>117:25:04 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. We'll handle the tape recorder.</div>
<div><b>117:25:11 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>117:25:32 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston. You're looking mighty fine down here. You have a. GO for plane change.</div>
<div><b>117:26:20 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. You have a GO for the burn.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>117:29:07 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay. Thirty seconds, and everything looks good here.</div>
<div><b>117:29:07 Roosa: </b>Okay, 30 seconds. Everything looks good, Ron.</div>
<div><b>117:29:11 CC: </b>Okay. Looking good down here.</div>

<div><b>117:29:54 Roosa: </b>And SHUTDOWN.</div>
<div><b>117:30:52 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston. No trim on this burn. Arid you can whip into P00, and we'll start sending seme uplink to you.</div>
<div><b>117:31:03 Roosa: </b>Okay. Just a second ... Do you need anything else The Delta is minus 12.3, and I guess your monitors are wrong. I hate to break up the discussion here, but I want to be right with you.</div>
<div><b>117:31:21 CC: </b>Roger. Delta-V^, was minus 12.3.</div>
<div><b>117:31:57 Roosa: </b>Okay. You wanted P00 and ACCEPT. Is that right, Ron?</div>
<div><b>117:32:09 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston. Do you have P00 and ACCEPT?</div>
<div><b>117:32:18 Roosa: </b>You've got P00 and ACCEPT now.</div>
<div><b>117:32:21 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>117:32:28 CC: </b>And, when you get things pretty well squared away there, I've got some 00 time and a photo pad and then a map update for you.</div>
<div><b>117:32:46 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'm ready to copy.</div>
<div><b>117:32:48 CC: </b>Okay. Your REFSMMAT 00 time, 142:25:30.00. Okay, your earthshine photo pad is on page 28; T-start is 118:45:37.</div>
<div><b>117:33:37 Roosa: </b>Okay, Ron. I copy REFSMMAT 00 time, 142:25:30.00; earthshine photo pad T-start, 118:45:37-</div>
<div><b>117:33:50 CC: </b>Okay. And then the next page - on page 29, your map update. For 180 - for 180, it's 119:39:59-And while we've got a little time here, do you happen to have the percent magazine for the P24 pass and also from the galactic survey?</div>
<div><b>117:34:29 Roosa: </b>Okay. ... right after ...</div>
<div><b>117:34:41 CC: </b>Stu, wait a minute. I can't read you there. You might check - try tweaking on the OMNI - or tweaking up the HIGH GAIN, please.</div>
<div><b>117:34:58 Roosa: </b>How do you read, now?</div>
<div><b>117:35:01 CC: </b>Still got a lot of - Hey, there It's quieted down-It should be good now.</div>
<div><b>117:35:10 Roosa: </b>Okay. Let's start with map update.</div>
<div><b>117:35:14 CC: </b>Okay, go ahead.</div>
<div><b>117:35:19 Roosa: </b>I didn't get it.</div>
<div><b>117:35:21 CC: </b>Oh, okay. Map update, REV 20 - -</div>
<div><b>117:35:22 Roosa: </b>Went out on me.</div>
<div><b>117:35:25 CC: </b>- - is l8 - for the 180, 119:39:59.</div>
<div><b>117:35:37 Roosa: </b>Okay; 119:39:59-</div>
<div><b>117:35:40 CC: </b>And the computer's yours.</div>
<div><b>117:35:53 CC: </b>And, Stu, if you got it there, we need the percent of the magazine remaining from your P24 passes and also from the galactic survey.</div>
<div><b>117:36:38 Roosa: </b>Okay, Ron. . I think I've got you again.</div>
<div><b>117:36:40 CC: </b>Okay, good. Go. Okay. Did you hear the request for the - -</div>
<div><b>117:36:47 Roosa: </b>I got the map update.</div>
<div><b>117:36:51 CC: </b>Okay. And we need the percent remaining on your magazine from P24 and your galactic survey. Over.</div>
<div><b>117:37:04 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>117:37:11 Roosa: </b>Okay; on the galactic survey is 73 percent.</div>
<div><b>117:37:18 CC: </b>Copy; 73 percent.</div>
<div><b>117:37:22 Roosa: </b>And on the landmark tracking, that's magazine B, it's 50 percent.</div>
<div><b>117:37:29 CC: </b>MAG Bravo, 50 percent.</div>
<div><b>117:37:44 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. You can go ahead and press on, and whip into your P52 attitude there.</div>
<div><b>117:37:49 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>117:37:55 CC: </b>And, whenever you get some time there, maybe while you're torquing P52 or something, you can read back your TEI-34 preliminary pad.</div>
<div><b>117:38:11 Roosa: </b>Okay,</div>
<div><b>118:00:40 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston. We're back with you again.</div>
<div><b>118:00:49 Roosa: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>118:05:01 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston. You got about 30 seconds here before T-start time on the earthshine.</div>
<div><b>118:05:09 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>118:06:02 CC: </b>Okay, Stu; Houston here. Looks like this might be a good time to read back your TEI-34 pad to us.</div>
<div><b>118:06:13 Roosa: </b>Just a minute, Ron. I got to configure one more camera, here.</div>
<div><b>118:06:18 CC: </b>Oh, okay, I -</div>
<div><b>118:07:10 CC: </b>And, Stu, just as a matter of interest, Ed now has been out 4 hours and 28 minutes. They're back at the LM now cleaning up the stuff, and they're about ready to crawl back in.</div>
<div><b>118:11:47 CC: </b>And, Kitty Hawk; Houston. Comm down here is getting lousy again.</div>
<div><b>118:13:03 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston in the blind. It's time to change your shutter speed. Your data camera to 1/I5th; your DAC, l/50th.</div>
<div><b>119:23:33 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>119:23:39 Roosa: </b>Oh, howdy, Houston; Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>119:23:42 CC: </b>Howdy, Stu, You're loud and clear. Sounds better than it has in a while. Maroon Team's now on duty, and I got a number of words for you when you get a chance to listen to me.</div>
<div><b>119:25:40 Roosa: </b>How do you read, Gordon?</div>
<div><b>119:25:41 CC: </b>Stu, I'm reading you about 3 by 3, now. How do read me?</div>
<div><b>119:25:49 Roosa: </b>Okay. You're 5 square. Looks like the comm keeps coming and going.</div>
<div><b>119:25:56 CC: </b>Roger. You're loud and clear, now. And starting through my list of things to tell you here, we've a - first of all, the LM guys are back in the LM. They got about a 4-hour 48-minute EVA and completed all the ALSEP deploy. And - pretty good shape and got quite a batch of rocks back in with them.</div>
<div><b>119:26:26 Roosa: </b>Hey, that sounds great. How was the TV from the surface?</div>
<div><b>119:26:30 CC: </b>It was beautiful. We had live TV through just about everything they did, including all the ALSEP deploy, and - and it couldn't have been much better.</div>
<div><b>119:26:47 Roosa: </b>Hey, that sounds real good.</div>
<div><b>119:26:50 CC: </b>Okay. Stuff for you. We're going to ask you to use 5-degree dead band during the sleep period to help us stay on the HIGH GAIN better, and hope we can get it a little higher percentage of HIGH BIT RATE while you're sleeping. If this results in too much RCS activity and keeps you awake, then we'll consider - well, we'll most likely then go back to the 10 degree if that's . considerably quieter. Over.</div>
<div><b>119:27:26 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>119:27:29 CC: </b>Okay. Still hanging our - your readback of the TEI-34 preliminary pad. Also, would like the magazine percentage and frame numbers at the end of earthside. That should be listed under Solo Book at 119:09. And the P52 data, and I'll take any of that in any order that you come to it. Over.</div>
<div><b>119:27:58 Roosa: </b>Okay. Let's start with the TEI-34 - -</div>
<div><b>119:28:04 CC: </b>Okay - -</div>
<div><b>119:28:05 Roosa: </b>334930; minus 0.711 minus 0.02; 149:15:34.58; plus 3018.2, plus 1649,1, minus 0283.4; 181, 108, 029; and NA; DELTA-V total, 3451.0; 2:25; 3426.9; 11, 125.3, 22.7; boresight star NA; NOUN 61, minus 27.03, minus 171.50; l160.8, 36251; 216:23:32; Sirius and Rigel, 130, 129, 0l8; four jet, 12 seconds; longitude and T. , IS plus 178:69 assumes plane change burn and lift-off REFSMMAT; with TEI REFSMMAT attitude 180:00.</div>
<div><b>119:29:32 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. Readback's good, except for one omission on NOUN 44. Your height to perigee is a plus 0019.0. Over.</div>
<div><b>119:29:48 Roosa: </b>Oh, very good. Hp, plus 0019.0.</div>
<div><b>119:29:52 CC: </b>Okay. Readback's good.</div>
<div><b>119:29:53 Roosa: </b>And on the magazines - the mag - okay, magazine S ended up with frame number 57; magazine K, 55 percent; the P52: NOUN 93, 00.027, 00.065, that's a minus and a minus; plus 00.018. They were torqued at 119:27:15.</div>
<div><b>119:30:34 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. Copy 55 percent on Kilo; and frame 57 on Foxtrot; and a minus 00.027, a minus 00.065, a plus 00.018, at 119:27:15.</div>
<div><b>119:30:59 Roosa: </b>Okay. That Hasselblad magazine is Sierra, S. Frame number 57-</div>
<div><b>119:31:06 CC: </b>Okay, Sierra.</div>
<div><b>119:31:12 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>119:31:55 Roosa: </b>Okay, Gordon. I just set you up a 5-degree dead band in this attitude; looks like it's a pretty good one for the HIGH GAIN.</div>
<div><b>119:33:08 CC: </b>Roger, Stu.</div>
<div><b>119:37:55 Roosa: </b>And, Houston; Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>119:37:58 CC: </b>Go ahead, Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>119:38:03 Roosa: </b>Okay. Have you got good enough lockup for an E-memory dump?</div>
<div><b>119:38:09 CC: </b>Stand by to check.</div>
<div><b>119:38:18 Roosa: </b>Say again, Gordon.</div>
<div><b>119:38:24 CC: </b>Stu, you are GO for the E-MOD dump. Let us have it.</div>
<div><b>119:38:31 Roosa: </b>Okay, coming at you.</div>
<div><b>119:38:54 Roosa: </b>And, Gordon. And as far as crew status, I'm in good health, no medication; and I have some onboard read-outs.</div>
<div><b>119:39:01 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. Stand by on the read-out; I'm working with the LM here on the other channel.</div>
<div><b>119:39:11 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>119:39:22 CC: </b>Okay, Stu; ready to copy the onboard read-outs. I was tied up with Ed, there.</div>
<div><b>119:39:32 Roosa: </b>Okay. BATTERY C is 37-0; PYR0 BATTERY A, 37-2; PYR0 BATTERY B, 37.2; RCS: A, 80; B, 71; C, 74; D, 73.</div>
<div><b>119:39:53 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. Copied all that.</div>
<div><b>119:44:06 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>119:44:11 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>119:44:13 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk. Got some S-band things for you. Got a - I'd like to have you put the S-BAND NORMAL VOICE switch to OFF, set the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA to WIDE and MANUAL, and use your present angles.</div>
<div><b>119:44:37 CC: </b>And Kitty Hawk - -</div>
<div><b>119:44:40 Roosa: </b>Okay. You want WIDE - Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>119:44:44 CC: </b>Okay. On the S-BAND NORMAL VOICE to OFF, that's when you're getting ready to go to sleep. But they do want the HIGH GAIN to WIDE and MANUAL, and you already have the good angles.</div>
<div><b>119:45:00 Roosa: </b>Okay. Going WIDE.</div>
<div><b>119:48:58 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>119:49:03 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>119:49:06 CC: </b>Okay. Got a couple of short messages for you before we close up shop. The - in a position to stop and talk a minute?</div>
<div><b>119:49:19 Roosa: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>119:49:21 CC: </b>Okay. First of all, let's say that REVs 25 and 26 are going to be nominal, no matter - as far as you're concerned - no matter what other activities people decide to juggle around. And, in case you didn't get the word, the President called Control Center, here awhile back, and offered us his congratulations to all of you, and the team down here for doing a good job; and as soon as we get a transcript of that, why, we'll read it up to you. The third thing is that Hycon camera. We've been talking to the Hycon people; and they're of the opinion that many of the things we've been chasing, some of the shutter oscillations and so forth, would not occur if the - or could not occur - if the counter is, in fact, counting off with each film advance; and it's our LMPression that, normally, you've been seeing the film counter advance. So, we've got a couple of steps we'd like to have you try in order to verify camera operation. The betting is that we have a good chance that the camera is functioning normally as far as taking pictures, and the noise may or may not be extraneous. The first question is status of MAG W. And if it still has some film on it, we'd like you to use it as the one to perform the check I'm going to describe to you.</div>
<div><b>119:51:05 Roosa: </b>Yes, it's still got film. I don't know how much, but we haven't hit the end of it yet.</div>
<div><b>119:51:12 CC: </b>Okay. It won't take much. Briefly, what we're going to do is to check visually and have you look to see if the shutter's operating. And we'll do this by looking down the lens barrel, looking from the - the operating end back towards the shutter. And what you're going to be seeing is -you won't see the shutter slit go across, but you will see the motion; and you should be able to detect the direction of motion, and the time of it. And you may want to use your flashlight to look down into the lens barrel and see what a - what you're doing. I'll read you some details - a detailed procedure; I just want to give you an outline first of what we're doing.</div>
<div><b>119:52:00 Roosa: </b>Okay. What did they have to say about that check that we made where you look inside to make sure that the slit is an inch from the side.</div>
<div><b>119:52:12 CC: </b>Okay -</div>
<div><b>119:52:14 Roosa: </b>You know ... and -</div>
<div><b>119:52:15 CC: </b>I'll - I'll check on that one; I'm not sure.</div>
<div><b>119:52:34 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. I understand that they're satisfied with what you saw, and they think that - that looks normal, which is one of the things that makes us think that the camera is probably operating normally. And if it turns out that the shutter is oscillating, what you're going to see is just a blur; but, again, you'll see a - the - the blur will appear to oscillate; and I think you'll be able to detect that the shutter is going from side to side; and it just looks like a big flash. And I - if you'll put the - put a flashlight in the lens with you as you look in there, I think you'll be able to see it; and you may even see one of the seams on the Mylar, when it comes to a stop. So, with that description of what it is you're going to be looking at, I'll read you the detailed procedures, if. you're ready.</div>
<div><b>119:53:34 Roosa: </b>Okay. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>119:53:38 CC: </b>Okay. We'll use the magazine W, because we're not going to use much film. We'd like to finish that one off. Go ahead and put the camera on the couch, or wherever it's convenient for you, with the lens opening visible to you. And you might want to tie the camera down, because we're going to operate it. Go ahead and hook up the camera according to the instruction decal; do everything in the normal orders. Like to have you make the following settings: for the MODE, we'd like to use AUTO; the shutter should be on l/50th of a second; the RANGE, 99-9; and the FRAME RATE at 60. Once you have the control box set up, turn the power to ON; and we'd like to have you observe the shutter operation by looking through the lens and use the penlight. And go ahead and run this thing, say 10 cycles. Like to have you also verify that the magazine sP00ls are rotating and that the counter is counting for each actuation that you observe.</div>
<div><b>119:54:50 Roosa: </b>Yes, I can already verify that. The counter counts, and the sP00ls rotate.</div>
<div><b>119:54:55 CC: </b>Okay. Has there been any instance when the counter didn't count when it was making its funny noises and so forth?</div>
<div><b>119:55:08 Roosa: </b>No. Not - I don't - don't believe so at all.</div>
<div><b>119:55:12 CC: </b>Okay, that's encouraging. I think the voting down here is that you probably have a functioning camera. What we'd like for you to do is - do this little test at your convenience, and let us know what you see. If it works out that this is one of these times where the test is performed, and the camera sounds like it's operating okay, go ahead and run the test; but don't sit there and run the camera trying to make it duplicate the sounds you've heard before. And what we're going to do is assume that if you see a shutter move, and it sounds right - we're going to assume that it's okay. Now - then, later in the flight, if this thing starts to act up again, we'd like to have you go ahead and finish that pass using the film; assume again that it's working properly; but, at the first convenient time afterwards, perform this test again. And the time, of course, that we're most interested in is performing this test when the noises and so forth are coming out.</div>
<div><b>119:56:23 Roosa: </b>Okay. I don't think we?ll have to sweat finding that. Seem like it's all the time. Now, I still don't see what I'm looking for when I look down the - the lens. I know the shutter moves because I can actuate it and go in and look at the slit, and it's moved.</div>
<div><b>119:56:47 CC: </b>Okay. What we're trying to see, Stu, is that the slit is not oscillating. We've been able to duplicate your noises down here by setting up an oscillation in the slit, whereas the shutter just sits there and runs back and forth. And it's cycling. Just completely out of control. So, we want to verify that that's not our problem. In that case, if you look at the slit before and after an actuation, you would find that the slit had moved, but it wouldn't tell you that it was moving properly. And I think that's the big thing you're looking for.</div>
<div><b>119:57:28 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll do that sometime, first chance I get tomorrow.</div>
<div><b>119:58:14 Roosa: </b>And, Ken, another question.</div>
<div><b>119:58:18 CC: </b>Yes, sir.</div>
<div><b>119:58:22 Roosa: </b>Okay. What do they say about the - the shutter moving, FMC operating, and all that good-deal stuff with the switch in STANDBY?</div>
<div><b>119:58:35 CC: </b>Okay. We've run several tests where we've been able to duplicate that, but it's - it's not easy to correlate the way we've duplicated that with : what you've been saying. We've been able to lower the power into the camera and make it do that. And it'll sit there; and, when the timing logic gets out of sequence, then there's - there's a little -all the timing internal to the camera is run from a commutator. And this little commutator can get hung up on one sequence like the shutter operation, and it?ll sit there and do that. The reason the EMC seems to operate normally is that that's all an AC operation, and the problems that we have been able to duplicate have all been associated with DC.</div>
<div><b>119:59:31 Roosa: </b>Okay. I tried that - you know, I had it in 0TANI -BY, and I put the frame rate on zero - now I don't know whether there's a minimum, whether zero really means zero or not - but that didn?t seem to phase it. It went ahead and did its thing anyway.</div>
<div><b>119:59:47 CC: </b>That's - that's been our experience too, Stu. Whenever we oet this condition up due to a low-power input on the DC, why, once it gets into this uncontrolled shutter oscillation, why, all other controls are - seem to be ineffective.</div>
<div><b>120:00:10 CLIP: </b>Okay. And the noise is - is not synonymous with sporadic firings of the camera. You know, you can set sometimes in STANDBY POWER, ON, and all you have is the noise and no operation of the camera. Then, other times, you have the operation of the camera along with the noise.</div>
<div><b>120:00:34 CC: </b>Okay. I'm afraid we don't have a real good handle on that. And - we've been able to duplicate many of your symptoms, but we haven't been able to duplicate them all simultaneously. So, we're going to hang our hats on this check that you're making just to - to verify that - our assumption that the camera's probably taking photographs and operated normally. If it turns out that the shutter speeds have been off or something of that nature, once we know that - and we can determine that on the ground - we can process the film accordingly and -and recover all of the data. And just as a backup procedure, we've had a lot of people working around the theory here that - to see what we can do - how we'd use our film if we finally have a limited amount or how we want to apportion our other film resources to take the place in case this camera check doesn't pass.</div>
<div><b>120:01:40 Roosa: </b>Okay. So, if the shutter's not oscillating, we can press a:iead. That's the plan, huh?</div>
<div><b>120:01:46 CC: </b>Yes, sir. And just in case it doesn't act up the one time you look at it, which seems to be one of nature's rules, why go ahead and assume it's working fine; and, next time it does act up, why, we'll run the test whenever it's convenient.</div>
<div><b>120:02:07 Roosa: </b>All right.</div>
<div><b>120:02:09 CC: </b>You having a good time up there?</div>
<div><b>120:02:14 Roosa: </b>Yes, man.</div>
<div><b>120:02:19 CC: </b>Sure sounds like it. You guys have really done a good job.</div>
<div><b>120:02:22 Roosa: </b>Okay. We'll, I think I'm going to see - Yes, I think I'm going to see if I can have a little chow and sack out here. It's been a long day. Hey, would It help anybody if I'd run that check now, or should I - Is it all right if I wait until . in the morning?</div>
<div><b>120:02:49 CC: </b>Well, I think - just run it the next time it's convenient for you.</div>
<div><b>120:03:00 Roosa: </b>Okay. Unless - unless you think it would be a breakthrough somebody could work on tonight, I'd just as soon wait until tomorrow.</div>
<div><b>120:03:06 CC: </b>That sounds good. Just give us a call whenever you get it done.</div>
<div><b>120:03:13 Roosa: </b>Okay. And I think, as I told Gordon there, you know, I did take the pictures of the - of the ?landing, just assuming that maybe the thing was working right. I did - I did not take that target 16, however, because I thought maybe we could get it again if the thing gets to working right.</div>
<div><b>120:03:32 CC: </b>Okay. Sounds good.</div>
<div><b>120:04:42 Roosa: </b>Hey, Ken? One other question.</div>
<div><b>120:04:48 CC: </b>Okay. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>120:04:52 Roosa: </b>Okay. Originally, criteria been that that shutter slit would stop an inch from the side. That - that's not really an iron-clad operating mode, then. Is that correct?</div>
<div><b>120:05:14 CC: </b>Well, I'm not - real sure what you mean by an iron-clad, operating mode, Stu. It - it indicates that the - the shutter is, in fact, still being properly sync'ed. Tells you that the timing sync hasn't been lost, but it doesn't tell you that the shutter is firing at the proper time. It just means that it's - the shutter curtain itself is still hooked up.</div>
<div><b>120:05:43 Roosa: </b>Okay. Put I'm sure you got the word that it - you. know, you can trip this beauty and sometimes it stops an inch from the side like it should; and then, the four or five times that I looked at that little operation, twice it stopped down maybe twice that far, maybe 2 inches or a little more out. It didn't - it didn't always stop the same distance out.</div>
<div><b>120:06:12 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. Gordy says that's enough. That's an indication that we do have a sync problem.</div>
<div><b>120:06:30 CC: </b>I guess one thing I'd like some verification on, Stu, is the randomness of this oscillation that you're getting. Does it happen the same in STANDBY and AUTO?</div>
<div><b>120:06:47 CMI: </b>You mean the noise?</div>
<div><b>120:06:49 CC: </b>Yes, sir.</div>
<div><b>120:06:54 Roosa: </b>Yes. it's - it doesn't change when you go from STANDBY to AUTO. It doesn't change when you move the NONESSENTIAL BUS switch from MAIN A to MAIN B. It doesn?t change when you poke around on the connector on 227. It just seems like it's there, and - in all the modes. It - it - like it [sic] say, it started intermittently on that low pass. Came on, then went back off again. But now, every time that I've turned the power on, I've gotten the noise. I don't always get the shutter operation - 1 meant the - well, the shutter operation as far as the counter moving and the FMC operating But the noise is always there.</div>
<div><b>120:07:58 CC: </b>Okay. And can you associate that more with AUTO than STANDBY? Anything like that?</div>
<div><b>120:08:11 Roosa: </b>That's a negative.</div>
<div><b>120:08:13 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>120:08:14 Roosa: </b>You turn the power on in STANDBY, and it's there.</div>
<div><b>120:08:16 CC: </b>All right.</div>
<div><b>120:08:17 Roosa: </b>And you go to AUTO - You go to AUTO and you start taking the pictures, but the noise is still there.</div>
<div><b>120:08:28 CC: </b>Okay. Understand, Thank you.</div>
<div><b>120:10:03 Roosa: </b>Okay, Ken. I'm going to turn off my handy-dandy switch here, and we'll see you all in the morning.</div>
<div><b>120:10:09 CC: </b>All right, sir. All your systems look GO.</div>
<div><b>120:10:15 Roosa: </b>Jolly good.</div>
<div><b>120:11:30 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. This is in the blind. No need to answer. Should you remember it, I want -being sure that your biomed's plugged in.</div>
<div><b>120:57:00 : </b>BEGIN LUNAR REV 21</div>
<div><b>129:13:26 CC: </b>Hello, Kitty Hawk. Good morning, Kitty Hawk. This is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>129:13:39 Roosa: </b>Hello, Houston; Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>129:14:01 CC: </b>Hello, Stu. Good morning. You're loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>129:14:09 Roosa: </b>iUfjer. Same litre; must have been a good, comm attitude.</div>
<div><b>129:14:14 CC: </b>Roger. I guess we?re coming up in about roughly i-5 minutes starting this bistatic radar; and I have some pads to get up plus a little discuss'on; so, if you'll grab the Solo Book, I'll give you a couple of them right now.</div>
<div><b>129:14:19 Roosa: </b>Okay. I've got it.</div>
<div><b>129:14:25 CC: </b>Okay. Got a inu p update, REV 26, for page 33.</div>
<div><b>129:14:35 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>129:14:40 CC: </b>LCS is 131:05:17; l80 at 131:30:08; AOS, 131:51:34 Co ahead.</div>
<div><b>129:15:15 Roosa: </b>Okay. 131:05:17, 131:30:08, 131:51:34.</div>
<div><b>129:15:24 CC: </b>Okay. You got that one okay. Same page, the vertical stereo photo pad: T-start, 131:44:21; T-stop, 132:32:42. Over.</div>
<div><b>129:15:49 Roosa: </b>Roger. 131:44:21, 132:33:42.</div>
<div><b>129:15:52 CC: </b>You gut that one okay. And the page before, your consumables update. Pur a GET of 129:55; RCS total, 64 percent; quad A, 67; Baker, 61; Charlie, 66; Delta, 63. tank 1, 56; tank 2, 56; 0^ tank 1, 79; tank 2, 78; tank 3, 26 percent. Over.</div>
<div><b>129:16:43 Roosa: </b>Okay. 129:55; RCS total, 64; quads, 64, 67, 61, 63; H<sub>2</sub>, 56, 56; 02, 79, 78, 26.</div>
<div><b>129:17:03 CC: </b>Roger. That's correct, Stu.</div>
<div><b>129:17:25 CC: </b>Stu, this is Houston. Would you give us P00 and ACCEPT, and we'll give you a state vector.</div>
<div><b>129:17:32 Roosa: </b>Okay. You have it.</div>
<div><b>129:18:20 CC: </b>Stu, this is Houston. Do you have time for a little conversation?</div>
<div><b>129:18:23 Roosa: </b>Y OS , go ;.! iifl lJ. ,</div>
<div><b>129:18:30 CC: </b>Okay. As far as the plan ahead for today, REV 25 and 26, there are no changes in the Solo Book. We need to know if you, by any chance, got up early and did anything more to the Hycon in the way of the procedures that Mattingly gave to you last night. If you didn't, anyway, w-^ need to find out the answer on the Hycon by the next REV or so, so we can choose the plan that we're going to take depending on the status to get Descartes photos. Over.</div>
<div><b>129:19:13 Roosa: </b>Well, I planned on doing that, but I didn't make it, Gordon. I'll try to get to it just as soon as I can.</div>
<div><b>129:19:20 CC: </b>Okay. I guess he probably went into great detail. The main thing is to determine if the shutter looks like it's working right. And if the shutter is working right and it's advancing film, even though it's making noise, they'll tell us it's worth at least trying to use it. If the shutter is not working, we'll N0-G0 it and just go all the way with the Hasselblad 500 millimeter.</div>
<div><b>129:19:55 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll try to get on it.</div>
<div><b>129:19:58 CC: </b>And at any rate, we're going to take at least one pass with the 500 millimeter to be sure. Also, we're looking like we may give you a stowage change to LMProve L/D. That will be coming later if we decide that it's necessary. And there is a change to what we gave you for normal docking procedures. If you can turn to the docking part of the Solo Book, I might as well give you that right now.</div>
<div><b>129:20:44 Roosa: </b>Okay. We've got a little while before we get to that one, Gordon. If it's all right with you, why don't we hold off; and I'll get to cracking here.</div>
<div><b>129:20:52 CC: </b>Okay. Fine.</div>
<div><b>129:21:32 CC: </b>Stu, Houston. We're going to send up another uplink. What it is is an uplink to - something in the computer called FANG, which is your short burn/thrust constant. It should take out the slight error that you saw on the first burn.</div>
<div><b>129:21:53 Roosa: </b>Iley, that's a good show. Appreciate those updates.</div>
<div><b>129:22:20 CC: </b>Slu, this is Houston. Can you give us a quick handle on how well you slept last night.</div>
<div><b>129:22:32 Roosa: </b>Oh, I slept about normal. I guess I probably got about 6 hours sleep, maybe 5 and a half, 6.</div>
<div><b>129:22:41 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>129:22:46 Roosa: </b>And I had lie medication, and I guess there's no sense in f\i .nine out my dosimeter or even getting if. out of r.K pocket. I've got the broken one.</div>
<div><b>129:22:55 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>129:23:11 Roosa: </b>And, Gordon, just so you'll know, I'll work on that Hycon over here during the eat period from 130:40, starting in that time frame; and I won't get a chance to give an answer to you, I guess, unLil we come back around on the other pass; but I'll, regardless of how it turns out, you want me to press ahead with the normal procedures here at 131 on that pad 30 on the 131:40, huh?</div>
<div><b>129:23:53 CC: </b>That's affirmative, Stu. And an answer by that time will be plenty good enough. The next two REVs should be all nominal configures. And we're through with the computer, also.</div>
<div><b>129:24:10 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>129:26:33 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>129:26:38 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>129:26:39 CC: </b>Okay, we're all configured for the bistatic radar test down here; if you'll go ahead and do the procedure as shown on 130-10 in the book, VHF ANTENNA LEFT, in OMNI Charlie; and we'll talk to you next time around, I guess.</div>
<div><b>129:27:08 Roosa: </b>Okay. I understand that we're all configured, and you've got all your commands in. And you want me to go to VHF LEFT and S-3AND - I meant to OMNI Charlie, now.</div>
<div><b>129:27:27 CC: </b>That's affirmative, Stu.</div>
<div><b>129:27:32 Roosa: </b>Okay. I verify VHF ANTENNA LEFT, and I'm going to OMNI Charlie. And guess I'll talk to you later.</div>
<div><b>129:27:42 CC: </b>Adios.</div>
<div><b>130:49:00 : </b>BEGIN LUNAR REV 26</div>
<div><b>131:12:02 Roosa: </b>Houston, do you read Kitty Hawk?</div>
<div><b>131:12:06 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. You're way down in the mud there. Try it again.</div>
<div><b>131:12:12 Roosa: </b>Okay, how do you read?</div>
<div><b>131:12:14 CC: </b>Okay, you're still real weak, Stu.</div>
<div><b>131:12:22 Roosa: </b>Stand by a second.</div>
<div><b>131:12:33 CC: </b>Try it agdin now, Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>131:12:39 Roosa: </b>Okay, Houston; Kitty Hawk. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>131:12:42 CC: </b>Hey, there, I got you loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>131:12:49 Roosa: </b>Okay, you ready for some words on the Hycon?</div>
<div><b>131:12:51 CC: </b>We're standing by.</div>
<div><b>131:12:56 Roosa: </b>Okay. I did that little routine that Ken talked to me about last night; and, sure enough, that noise we hear is the shutter oscillating; and you put the power on MODE switch, STAND BY, and the shutter sits there and oscillates back and forth. If you hit - if you go to AUTO and when the intervalometer times, the shutter appears to stop while - during the FMC. When the FMC kicks up, the shutter appears to stop at that point, then goes back to oscillating again. It does the same thing in single-frame mode.</div>
<div><b>131:13:43 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. I think when you go to AUTO in the intervalometer time the shutter appears to stop. Does it a - kind of follow the intervalometer setting at all?</div>
<div><b>131:14:02 Roosa: </b>Yes. And the - and the - the FMC operates and the shutter appears to stop, and you know then ... Hello, how do you read?</div>
<div><b>131:14:24 CC: </b>Okay. I think I've got you again now -</div>
<div><b>131:14:27 Roosa: </b>Hello, Houston. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>131:14:30 CC: </b>Okay, I've got you again now, Stu. How am I?</div>
<div><b>131:14:33 Roosa: </b>Okay. Okay, you're loud and clear. And it does the same thing in the mode - in the single; whenever you hit the button, why the FMC operates and the shutter appears to stop, and then starts back oscillating.</div>
<div><b>131:15:01 CC: </b>Okay, Stu, When the shutter does oscillate on the thing, does it kind of go back and forth or does it seem like it keeps going around? In the same -you know, does it seem like it keeps going around in the same direction or does it oscillate back and forth?</div>
<div><b>131:15:27 Roosa: </b>Well, I guess I might have to look at it again to be ver - be real certain but I - yes, it goes back and forth. I might check that in a little bit if I get the chance - or when I get the chance, but it looked like it was just sitting there going back and forth on the thing.</div>
<div><b>131:15:54 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>131:16:34 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. What we're thinking is that - you know the shutter kind of goes back and forth anyhow; and if it goes back and forth kind of at the intervalometer setting, and the sP00ls rotate, you know, to indicate that the film is in fact moving, it looks like it may be operating in - in the AUTO mood - in the AUTO mode okay and we could probably be able to get some pictures. Now if that's a completely - you know, if the shutter kind of oscillates, not with respect to the intervalometer setting; it may not be working correctly, and I guess I'm still not quite clear in my own mind that if the shutter's oscillating back and forth at the rate of the intervalometer setting.</div>
<div><b>131:17:40 Roosa: </b>That's a negative on that one, Ron. It's a fast oscillation, like the check that Ken wanted me to make was the intervalometer set on 60 and - and so every, every second we - the intervalometer triggers and PMC operates, but the shutter in between, is just banging back and forth.</div>
<div><b>131:18:11 CC: </b>Okay, I understand now.</div>
<div><b>131:18:18 Roosa: </b>Anu. - and the osciallation on the shutter appears to stop at the time the intervalometer triggers.</div>
<div><b>131:18:29 CC: </b>Okay--</div>
<div><b>131:18:31 Roosa: </b>You know, I looked down the lens with a flashlight and I see - I looked down the lens with a flashlight and I see the shutter is sitting there going back and forth and it appears to freeze at the time the intervalometer triggers it ... back again.</div>
<div><b>131:19:01 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston. You faded out again there, I missed your last comment.</div>
<div><b>131:20:33 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>131:20:39 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>131:20:41 CC: </b>Okay. It looks like you - you're working on the HIGH GAIN there. We got PITCH of minus 84, and YAW - a PITCH of minus 84, and a YAW of 346.</div>
<div><b>131:21:14 CC: </b>Okay. I think we should have you now, Stu.</div>
<div><b>131:21:27 Roosa: </b>Yes. It looks - it looks pretty good, now.</div>
<div><b>131:21:29 CC: </b>Hey, it's beautiful. Okay. When the shutter does stop on the thing there at the 1-second intervals, can you see the shutter slip, at all?</div>
<div><b>131:21:48 Roosa: </b>No. I - I thought it might stop out there. No, I couldn't. And also when I - when I open - put magazine W in, I noticed the slit was right out in the middle of the - of the magazine there, if that means anything; and I didn?t - couldn?t particularly see the slip, when the - when the shutter stopped. But I can look for that again. You know, it's a little difficult to tell what I'm looking behind, to see whether I really should be able to see the slit or not. But i can't check it out for you right now. We've got the DC camera running off the scientific box, over there. Well, I guess you - unless you don't particularly want the HIGH BIT RATE anyway. But I can go ahead and power it up here in a minute and run through it, while you're on the line and answer any questions.</div>
<div><b>131:22:07 CC: </b>Okay. It doesn't look like that's going to cost us anything there. Don't forget you got the Langrenus B for your photo target there.</div>
<div><b>131:22:10 Roosa: </b>Yes. I'm watching for that one.</div>
<div><b>131:22:16 CC: </b>And, Stu, while I've got you here, I want you to slip over your flight plan there on 132:42 for the north galactic pole attitude. I got a different pitch attitude.</div>
<div><b>131:22:30 Roosa: </b>Okay. Would you hold that 1?</div>
<div><b>131:22:32 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>131:25:10 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. OMNI Bravo.</div>
<div><b>131:28:13 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. I know you're looking out the window there at Langrenus now, but when you set up for the camera there, let?s try a 10 frame per second instead of 60 - 10 frames per minute, I mean, instead of the 60, for the frame rate.</div>
<div><b>131:28:34 Roosa: </b>Stand by. I'll get that in a minute.</div>
<div><b>131:34:14 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Looks like the first thing we ought to whip up you here is some 500-millimeter procedures. So if you've got a place to copy those down - there's about 11 steps on it. And, the next REV we'll use the 500-millimeter.</div>
<div><b>131:34:41 Roosa: </b>Okay. Stand by.</div>
<div><b>131:35:09 Roosa: </b>Okay to read the ... right now ... take ...</div>
<div><b>131:35:14 CC: </b>Stand by 1, Stu. I just barely got you there.</div>
<div><b>131:35:28 CC: </b>Okay. Kitty Hawk, try the HIGH GAIN, the PITCH, minus 50; YAW, 181.</div>
<div><b>131:36:11 Roosa: </b>Okay. How do you read now?</div>
<div><b>131:36:12 CC: </b>Okay. You're real weak, Stu. How do you read me?</div>
<div><b>131:36:20 Roosa: </b>You're loud and clear. Coming in ...</div>
<div><b>131:36:23 CC: </b>Okay. I could just barely hear you, but if you're reading me good, why don't you go ahead and let me know when you're ready to copy some 50-millimeter procedures?</div>
<div><b>131:36:34 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'm ready to copy.</div>
<div><b>131:36:38 CC: </b>Okay. Step 1, configure camera CM4/EL/500/BW-PCM cable; the 16-millimeter control cable, (f/ll) l/250th, infinity; 42 frames, 5-second intervals; magazine Papa. Step 2, set COAS in left-hand rendezvous window; adjust for plus 10 degrees. VERB - Step 3, VERB 49, manuever to high-resolution photo attitude. And just a note: time to start the maneuver and the maneuver attitude will be updated. Step 4, change your DAP R^ to 11103 and, Stu, we talked about that - whether to use a 2 degree or half degree per second, there. I personally prefer the - you know the, 2 end the R . And, then if you don't quite hack it, you know, ... the load direct. Okay. Step 5 - -</div>
<div><b>131:38:55 Roosa: </b>...</div>
<div><b>131:38:57 CC: </b>I missed that, say again.</div>
<div><b>131:38:59 Roosa: </b>You know I never got a chance to try that ..., but I'll, if I get a chance ...</div>
<div><b>131:39:12 CC: </b>Okay. I didn't quite hear that, but I think you got it. Step 5, zero DET. Step 6, configure the DSE; HIGH BIT RATE, RECORD FORWARD, COMMAND RESET. Step 7, at T-start, EL camera on and DET startup. Step 8, at T-start plus 1 minute, ORDEAL, pitch 305, track Descartes with COAS.</div>
<div><b>131:40:31 CC: </b>Are you still with me, Stu?</div>
<div><b>131:40:43 CC: </b>Okay, I can't read you at all, now, Stu.</div>
<div><b>131:40:53 Roosa: </b>...</div>
<div><b>131:41:14 CC: </b>Okay, Stu, I'm going to go ahead and read you step 9. At T-start plus 3 minute 28 second, ORDEAL, pitch 215; terminate tracking; EL off. Step 10, configure DSE to LOW BIT RATE. Step 11, record frame number.</div>
<div><b>131:42:03 CC: </b>And, in the blind, that's it.</div>
<div><b>131:42:18 Roosa: </b>Okay, how do you read, Ron?</div>
<div><b>131:42:21 CC: </b>Okay, you're really weak, Stu. I don't know, if you - if you can read the ACC meter on the high gain, there. Maybe I can read you, if you can keep the high gain on.</div>
<div><b>131:43:35 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston, let me try one more time here. If you're reading me okay, I?ve got some more flight-plan updates for you here.</div>
<div><b>131:43:50 Roosa: </b>Okay, I'm reading you loud and clear, Ron.</div>
<div><b>131:43:52 CC: </b>Okay, Stu, you're still down, but let's do the flight-plan update. At 132:4o, change your pitch attitude on the north galactic pole there, change the pitch attitude to 280; HIGH GAIN angles, PITCH, minus 81; YAW 210.</div>
<div><b>131:44:35 CC: </b>Okay, skip on over in your solo book there to time at 133:31.</div>
<div><b>131:44:57 CC: </b>Delete the VERB 49 maneuver to the LTC attitude. And delete, at 133:40, the proceg - PRO to start the pitch rate. And delete all reference to LTC photography, target 2/8. Okay, at 134:00, add -You still with me, Stu?</div>
<div><b>131:46:01 Roosa: </b>No, I didn't get all of it, you dropped out for a while. I picked back up here at 133:40.</div>
<div><b>131:46:16 CC: </b>Okay, Stu, at 133:31 -</div>
<div><b>131:46:37 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>131:46:47 CC: </b>Okay, Stu, at 133:31, delete the VERB 49 maneuver to the LTC target. And at 133:40 - -</div>
<div><b>131:47:00 Roosa: </b>I got that, forget it.</div>
<div><b>131:47:03 CC: </b>Say again.</div>
<div><b>131:47:07 Roosa: </b>I said forget AOS. ... VERB 49 for the C0AS ...</div>
<div><b>131:48:15 CC: </b>Man, this comm is terrible; I can't read you.</div>
<div><b>131:48:25 Roosa: </b>Okay, if we're going to stop here now, I've got to get on to the ...</div>
<div><b>131:48:31 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>131:55:26 CC (onboard): </b>Roger; I copied - copied all of that.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>131:57:20 CC (onboard): </b>Roger. Serial number 1002 and 305.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>131:58:05 CC (onboard): </b>Okay. Give me a call when you get there, and I'll start the timing.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>131:58:16 CC (onboard): </b>Starting the clock.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>131:59:59 CC (onboard): </b>Go ahead, Ed.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>132:00:50 CC (onboard): </b>Okay. I got all - all readings, Ed.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>132:00:58 CC (onboard): </b>Roger. High scale.</div>
<div><b>132:08:14 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston. Noise stopped down here, we may have some comm now.</div>
<div><b>132:08:25 Roosa: </b>Hey, how about that, Houston? Looks like we got a good signal strength.</div>
<div><b>132:08:31 CC: </b>Beautiful. Man, oh man, that's great to hear your voice like that. Okay, Stu. I want to make sure that we get our 500-millimeter stuff up to you, and make sure you have that before we do anything else.</div>
<div><b>132:08:46 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>132:08:51 CC: </b>Okay, I'm not sure where I faded out on the update I was going to give to you. I passed up delete the vertical LTC photography stuff at 133:30. Did you get that?</div>
<div><b>132:09:10 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative. I got a 133:30, no VERB 49 maneuver, no PRO at ORDEAL 328, and delete all LTC targets , 2 dash 18.</div>
<div><b>132:09:23 CC: </b>Okay there now. How about over at 134?</div>
<div><b>132:09:31 Roosa: </b>No, I didn't get anything there.</div>
<div><b>132:09:33 CC: </b>Okay, at 134, add - I've got a VERB 49 to roll, 0; pitch, 248; and yaw, 0. Over.</div>
<div><b>132:09:55 Roosa: </b>Okay, at 134, VERB 49 to 0, 248, and 0.</div>
<div><b>132:09:59 CC: </b>Okay. And then use 500-millimeter porcedures, and did you get all of those?</div>
<div><b>132:10:14 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative. Let me just recap here slightly.</div>
<div><b>132:10:17 CC: </b>Okay. Wait 1, Stu. Let me get you your T-start time for the 500-millimeter there is at 134:20 -at 134:20, and T-start time is 134:20:19.</div>
<div><b>132:10:38 Roosa: </b>Okay. I had the ... and now tell me again, T-start.</div>
<div><b>132:10:46 CC: </b>Say again, Stu.</div>
<div><b>132:10:51 Roosa: </b>I did not get that last bit about the times. Give me those again.</div>
<div><b>132:10:55 CC: </b>Okay. At 134:20 in the flight plan there, T-start is 134:20 - 134:20:19. Okay. And, now we can go ahead and review those 500-millimeter procedures.</div>
<div><b>132:11:16 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>132:11:32 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'm going to configure the camera CM4, EL, 500, black and white, PCM cable, and 16-millimeter control cable, f/II, l/250th, infinity. I'm going to shoot 42 frames with me manually flicking them off every 5 seconds. I'll use magazine P, P as in Papa. And, I'll use the C0AS, set on 10 degrees, and do the VERB 49 maneuver. Probably won't change the DAP, last tracking went real well at MINIMUM LMPULSE.</div>
<div><b>132:12:24 CC: </b>Okay, we'll - look, while he's talking about that tracking - -</div>
<div><b>132:12:31 Roosa: </b>I'll zero the - I'll zero the event timer. I'll configure the DSE, HIGH BIT RATE, RECORD, FORWARD, COMMAND RESET. I guess I'll do that just prior to T-start. At T-start, I'll turn the camera on, start the event timer, and at T-start plus a minute, I should be in an ORDEAL pitch of 305, and I'll start the C0AS track of Descartes; and at T-start plus 328, should be around an ORDEAL pitch at 215. I'll terminate the track, turn the camera off, got to LOW BIT RATE, record the frame number.</div>
<div><b>132:13:12 CC: </b>Okay. Sounds real good there, Stu. Looks like you got it under control. I don't know, have you ever used that' 16-millimeter camera instead of the intervalometer, you know, on the PCM cable?</div>
<div><b>132:13:26 Roosa: </b>No, I sure haven't.</div>
<div><b>132:13:28 CC: </b>Okay. I've checked that out real good; and, every time you punch it, just like on a 16-millimeter, you take a picture, you know. And it'll reach all the way over to your left hand there, so you got that in your left hand and flipping away with your right hand on the MINIMUM LMPULSE, you know.</div>
<div><b>132:13:47 Roosa: </b>Okay. That shouldn?t be any problem. That COAS track and MINIMUM LMPULSE is extremely smooth., Ron. It just hangs right there.</div>
<div><b>132:13:56 CC: </b>Beautiful. Okay, the only difference as you notice; the rest of them are going to be at a zero roll so you'll be pitching the opposite direction on the thing as you did then, you did for the one for the - the last pass there.</div>
<div><b>132:14:12 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>132:14:14 CC: </b>And, I got some - -</div>
<div><b>132:14:15 Roosa: </b>I'm flexible, I'll be able to handle that.</div>
<div><b>132:14:19 CC: </b>Beautiful, I'm sure you can. Okay, at AOS, I got some AOS PITCH and YAW angles for you. At about 133.50, in there.</div>
<div><b>132:14:51 Roosa: </b>Okay. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>132:14:53 CC: </b>Okay. And, PITCH of minus 59, and YAW plus 345, instead of OMNI B, there.</div>
<div><b>132:15:10 Roosa: </b>Okay. In lieu of OMNI B, PITCH, minus 59; YAW, plus 345.</div>
<div><b>132:15:15 CC: </b>Roger. You'll be coming over the hill there in your lunar libration attitude.</div>
<div><b>132:15:29 Roosa: </b>Okay. And, the - on magazine Q on that vertical stereo, I ended up on frame number 187.</div>
<div><b>132:15:38 CC: </b>Roger. 187 on magazine Q. And, on page 33 there, do you have your torquing and angles for your P52?</div>
<div><b>132:15:51 Roosa: </b>Roger. Minus OO.O36, minus 00.157, plus 00.091 at a time of 131:18:30.</div>
<div><b>132:16:09 CC: </b>Roger. Minus 0.036, minus 0.157, plus 0.091, at 131:18:30.</div>
<div><b>132:16:20 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>132:16:22 CC: </b>Okay. Looks like you may have some time to mess around with this LTC, probably around 134, 35 or somewhere around there. Maybe before that. But, basically, it looks like it - Well, we're really not sure that it works or not, but we think it probably won't. But as a final check on it, if you get a chance, do the same procedures, as kind of before. Except, put your frame rate down to 10 frames per minute instead of 60. And, that'll be a slower operation there, and kind of observe, first of all, looking through the lens you should be able to see the shutter slit or at least a piece of tape-looking-like stuff, you know, where the shutter slit is; and kind of get an idea of what's happening to the shutter slit if you can. And, from what I understand, what you said before is that, it looks like it's zigging back and forth until the intervalometer hits - hits the thing, and then it kind of stops for a second or something, and then it starts zigging back and forth, again. Is that kind of correct?</div>
<div><b>132:17:33 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative. That's - that's the way it looked a while ago.</div>
<div><b>132:17:40 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>132:17:41 Roosa: </b>It freezes on the intervalometer ... trips.</div>
<div><b>132:17:46 CC: </b>Okay. I understand it freezes when the intervalometer - kind of trips the system, so to speak.</div>
<div><b>132:17:56 Roosa: </b>That's true, and it also does it when you have the ... in signal and you push the button.</div>
<div><b>132:18:03 CC: </b>I don't know what the problem is; we've got a good signal strength.</div>
<div><b>132:18:06 CC: </b>You faded out on that one, Stu, I missed it.</div>
<div><b>132:18:14 Roosa: </b>Okay. And it has the same operation in both switch signals, when you push the signal ... button.</div>
<div><b>132:18:24 CC: </b>Okay. You might try tweaking up your HIGH GAIN there a little bit, Stu. I can't hear you.</div>
<div><b>132:18:35 CC: </b>YAW is plus 210.</div>
<div><b>132:18:49 Roosa: </b>I'm showing a real good signal strength, Ron.</div>
<div><b>132:18:53 CC: </b>Okay. You're just real weak, but clear now. So, I think I can hear it.</div>
<div><b>132:19:01 Roosa: </b>Okay. How's that?</div>
<div><b>132:19:07 CC: </b>Okay. Real weak, but clear, I think.</div>
<div><b>132:20:01 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>132:20:06 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston; Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>132:20:08 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. We're going to rewind - start the tape recorder rewinding at LOS on the thing. And, when you see the barber pole, indicating that it's completely rewound, then go ahead and do your normal procedures, and start at LOW BIT RATE, you know, COMMAND RESET, and et cetera.</div>
<div><b>132:20:28 Roosa: </b>Yes. That will be a good deal, you know at the start of that stereostrip, I checked the tape at LOS, and it was gray, and by the time we got to the start of the stereostrip it had - I guess it hadn't been rewound.</div>
<div><b>132:20:44 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>132:20:45 Roosa: </b>I wound it back, and we only got about 45 seconds of HIGH BIT RATE on the start of that stereostrip.</div>
<div><b>132:20:54 CC: </b>Okay. Understand.</div>
<div><b>132:21:20 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. We got about 2 minutes of - until LOS, and you might be advised that Ed and A1 are out roaming around the lunar surface, working up toward Cone - Cone Crater. I kind of lost track of exactly where they are but - -</div>
<div><b>132:21:37 Roosa: </b>Sounds ... Sounds real good. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>132:22:44 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. About 30 seconds to LOS. Your 180 for REV 27 is 133:28:29.</div>
<div><b>132:23:00 Roosa: </b>Okay. 133:28:29.</div>
<div><b>132:23:03 CC: </b>Roger. LOS and AOS are off about a minute.</div>
<div><b>132:23:10 Roosa: </b>Okay. Hey, Ron, I - I find I can find my way without using that 180 time. Why don't we just discontinue that if things - ...</div>
<div><b>132:23:25 CC: </b>I'll catch it next time around; I missed it.</div>
<div><b>132:47:00 : </b>BEGIN LUNAR REV 27</div>
<div><b>133:11:33 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. I've got your data now.</div>
<div><b>133:12:32 Roosa: </b>Hello, Houston. How do you read Kitty Hawk?</div>
<div><b>133:12:36 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. I think I got you that time. Kind of weak though.</div>
<div><b>133:12:44 Roosa: </b>Okay. It looks like we're in lockup, here. You?re loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>133:15:09 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. We got rid of the background noise now; probably have some good comm here.</div>
<div><b>133:15:18 Roosa: </b>Roger, Ron. That - that's the highest signal strength I've seen so far.</div>
<div><b>133:15:23 CC: </b>Man, that's the best I've heard you. Sounds real good.</div>
<div><b>133:15:29 CC: </b>Hey, Stu, I guess the one thing I really didn't get out of you in talking about the Hycon camera, do you have any confidence - confidence at all in that thing?</div>
<div><b>133:15:48 Roosa: </b>Well, I guess I really don't know the inner workings well enough to - to say that, Ron. The racket sure does sound bad; but, when you see the - see the. frame counter going, you figure It's doing something. I don't really know. I didn't get a chance to look at it. I thought, as soon as we finish up here, I'll - I've got it out; and, we get a chance, why, we'll - we'll run through an exercise here with - with you on the loop and maybe we can then arrive at some conclusion.</div>
<div><b>133:16:26 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>133:16:48 CC: </b>Just for your information, A1 and Ed are just about on the edge of Cone Crater now.</div>
<div><b>133:16:59 Roosa: </b>Oh, great. How was the climb?</div>
<div><b>133:17:03 CC: </b>Well, it was a little further away, I think, than they really thought it was going to be. They're going to go - go up on the west rim, I guess, instead of the east rim. What it looks like right now. It's kind of the southwest rim. They're sending back all kinds of good-deal information about the soil and texture and what have you - the rocks.</div>
<div><b>133:17:50 CC: </b>And Stu, I guess you've been taking a look - haven you? - at the - in our landmark book there in the De - Descartes COAS pictures?</div>
<div><b>133:18:02 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>133:18:03 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>133:22:20 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>133:22:26 Roosa: </b>Go, Houston.</div>
<div><b>133:22:27 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. I've got some HIGH GAIN angles for you for after the COAS maneuver. A PITCH of minus 48 and a YAW of 177.</div>
<div><b>133:22:51 Roosa: </b>Okay. PITCH, minus 48; YAW, 177-</div>
<div><b>133:22:54 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>133:23:27 Roosa: </b>Well, I sure hate to ruin this good comm, but I'll start my maneuver.</div>
<div><b>133:23:31 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>133:24:39 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. OMNI Bravo.</div>
<div><b>133:28:38 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. OMNI Charlie.</div>
<div><b>133:46:44 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. We should have you now.</div>
<div><b>133:46:53 Roosa: </b>Okay, Ron. You're loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>133:46:54 CC: </b>Okay. You're loud and clear there, Stu. How does it go?</div>
<div><b>133:47:01 Roosa: </b>Okay. Went real smooth, and the frame number is 48.</div>
<div><b>133:47:06 CC: </b>Roger. Frame 48. And you think you got some good flicks, huh?</div>
<div><b>133:47:15 Roosa: </b>That?s affirmative. I was touching it off once every 5 seconds and it was - it held right in there. And they should be good.</div>
<div><b>133:47:25 CC: </b>Beautiful! Okay. I guess you?re pressing then to checking out the LTC, right?</div>
<div><b>133:47:36 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative. I'll get it stretched out here and get it up and then get on with you and tell you what I see.</div>
<div><b>133:47:45 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>133:55:01 Roosa: </b>Okay, Houston. Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>133:55:04 CC: </b>Roger. Go, Stu.</div>
<div><b>133:55:07 Roosa: </b>Okay. As far as whether or not the shutter is oscillating or going in one direction, I can't tell. We did run out of film on this magazine W and that made it a little easier to see in there. With this shutter sticking like this, you're going to expose any film underneath it because, you know, it's moving at fast enough rate that I can see through and see the platen now. I can see the holes in the platen with the shutter oscillating. It goes fast. I'd say it's a couple of three times a second oscillation. Or at least that's the noise level, now. I'm not sure what the shutter's doing it's moving so fast. In AUTO and in single frame, when you push the button, the shutter does stop for just an instant, and just randomly, you will see the slit. Now it's not always there. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it isn't, sometimes It's a different width on the slit. Now, why don't we start there, and then I'll entertain the questions.</div>
<div><b>133:56:37 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. That sounds like that's a good explanation of what's happening. The shutter is oscillating back and forth and it does expose the film every time it oscillates, it looks like. And even in single frame, it stops - -</div>
<div><b>133:56:52 Roosa: </b>Yes. Well, I don't know whether - -</div>
<div><b>133:56:55 CC: </b>Yes. Go ahead, Stu.</div>
<div><b>133:57:00 Roosa: </b>I don't know whether it's oscillating or whether, you know, it's - I guess it would have to be though. That thing flips back and forth. Suffice it to say, there's always a slit over the film, the thing's moving so fast. I mean I can see through to the platen.</div>
<div><b>133:57:33 CC: </b>Okay, Stu, as far as the oscillating or whipping all of the way around, what we simulated here on the ground, is that the shutter just goes around and around in there. And you know - you get a real clicking - dot dot dot dot - you know, something like that. And I guess you've tried your frame rates at 10 frames a second.</div>
<div><b>133:57:53 Roosa: </b>That?s affirmative, it's on 10, and the interval-ometer works. And on the cycle of 10 a minute, why the shutter stops and then takes back up again.</div>
<div><b>133:58:10 CC: </b>Okay. Is the counter counting at the intervalometer setting, more or less?</div>
<div><b>133:58:19 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>133:58:21 CC: </b>Okay. So, my LMPression is that it's getting multiple exposures on each frame. Is that correct?</div>
<div><b>133:58:39 Roosa: </b>Yes, that would be it. Any film that's behind is going to be exposed as the slit moves back and forth. And like I say, the rate is fast enough that with your eye, you know, you can look right through the shutter in the center and see the holes in the platen while it's doing it's clicking thing.</div>
<div><b>133:59:04 CC: </b>Okay, understand.</div>
<div><b>133:59:15 Roosa: </b>And maybe if you could drum up any more questions, why - you know, this is a pretty good time; I've got the beast out here.</div>
<div><b>133:59:22 CC: </b>Okay, we've got our photo guys, here, I'll give them a poll and see if they've got any questions.</div>
<div><b>133:59:29 Roosa: </b>Okay. Hey, Ron, I want to make sure I'm making myself clear; so, keep asking me until you get across what you want to know.</div>
<div><b>133:59:43 CC: </b>Okay, Stu.</div>
<div><b>134:00:29 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. One question here. While the curtain is - or the shutter, you know, is clicking, sliding back and forth there, is the frame counter counting at that time or is it only counting - you know, kind of like when it's supposed to?</div>
<div><b>134:00:50 Roosa: </b>The frame counter is counting when it is supposed to.</div>
<div><b>134:01:02 CC: </b>Okay, the frame counter is counting when it's supposed to, and while the shutter is erratic, flipping back and forth or round and around, whatever it's doing, the frame counter is just standing still. Is that correct?</div>
<div><b>134:01:17 Roosa: </b>That is affirmative. It does not move with this clicking or with the shutter oscillation. It only counts either when you hit the single frame or when the intervalometer times.</div>
<div><b>134:01:32 CC: </b>Okay, understand.</div>
<div><b>134:02:11 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. It looks like we're still so uncertain on the Hycon, that we want to press on and use the 500 millimeter on the next REV. And we will not use the Hycon on the next REV.</div>
<div><b>134:02:43 Roosa: </b>Okay, I guess we need to talk a little bit about how we're going to do this, Ron.</div>
<div><b>134:02:54 CC: </b>Okay, I've got some flight-plan updates here for you. Starting out at 135:20 in your solo book, there.</div>
<div><b>134:03:03 Roosa: </b>Okay. 135:20; I'm there. .</div>
<div><b>134:03:05 CC: </b>Okay. Delete the VERB 49 maneuver and press on to 135:35. Delete the ORB RATE.</div>
<div><b>134:03:31 CC: </b>Delete - I hate to say this - delete King photo, before there at 135 degrees, about 45. And also delete the fan Crater strip there, target 4.</div>
<div><b>134:04:10 Roosa: </b>Okay, I've got you. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>134:04:14 CC: </b>Okay. And, of course, delete all references to the LTC photo on target 6. And then at 136:00, on page 38.</div>
<div><b>134:04:30 Roosa: </b>Okay, go ahead.</div>
<div><b>134:04:32 CC.: </b>Okay. And VERB 49 to roll 0, pitch 249, and yaw 0. Use 500-millimeter procedures. T-start, 136:18:40.</div>
<div><b>134:05:41 CC: </b>And, Kitty Hawk, Houston. Did you copy that?</div>
<div><b>134:05:54 Roosa: </b>Roger. Okay, a readback. We're marking off the 135:20, no VERB 49 maneuver; 135:35, no PRO on the ORDEAL; and marked off in blood is the King photos, the Fan Crater photos; deleting any reference to LTC target 6; and, at 136, we'll do a VERB 49 maneuver to 0, 249, 0; use the 500-millimeter procedures; T-start at 136:18:40.</div>
<div><b>134:06:31 CC: </b>Okay, that's good. And then I've got your map update for REV 28 on page 37, there.</div>
<div><b>134:06:42 Roosa: </b>Okay, now. This is another track of Descartes. Is that right, Ron?</div>
<div><b>134:06:50 CC: </b>That's affirmative. And stand by 1. I may have a slightly different aim point there.</div>
<div><b>134:07:00 CC: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>134:07:01 Roosa: </b>Okay. Ron, have you got your Descartes C0AS out?</div>
<div><b>134:07:10 CC: </b>Sure do.</div>
<div><b>134:07:13 Roosa: </b>Okay, mark down the aim point. The aim point is shown on it, that crater right by the center of the X.</div>
<div><b>134:07:23 CC: </b>Right.</div>
<div><b>134:07:24 Roosa: </b>That did show up when I first started. So, see right up toward the top of the page, two craters right together? I meant move up about a - oh a quarter of an inch from the center. Can you see a little doublet there?</div>
<div><b>134:07:41 CC: </b>Okay. I think I'm with you. Yes.</div>
<div><b>134:07:46 Roosa: </b>Okay. That was my aim point on that pass. Those -those two showed up better at first, before this one down here. So I picked up on them. And you know that's essentially between the two bright ones and about 3/16ths of an inch up from the center of the C0AS as shown on it.</div>
<div><b>134:08:12 CC: </b>Okay. I think - I'm not sure which way is up. Is it the bottom of the page or the top of the page now that you're talking about? I - I got a little doublet kind of - -</div>
<div><b>134:08:22 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>134:08:23 CC: </b>- - toward - toward the bottom of the page.</div>
<div><b>134:08:27 Roosa: </b>No, no. Take - take the center of the C0AS and move toward the top of the page about a quarter of an inch. They're not really touching each other, but there are two small craters there, just to the left of the center line of the C0AS.</div>
<div><b>134:08:43 .CC: </b>Okay. I've got you. I've got you.</div>
<div><b>134:08:49 Roosa: </b>Okay, that was my aim point on that - on that pass, and it - it stayed pretty good.</div>
<div><b>134:08:58 CC: </b>Okay, real good. Do you think you can pick up the - you know the - the aim point as on the COAS? As - as shown on the picture for this REV?</div>
<div><b>134:09:12 Roosa: </b>Yes, I think so. I - I can probably get down there ...</div>
<div><b>134:09:20 CC: </b>Okay. That'll be real good. And then if we have - -</div>
<div><b>134:09:22 Roosa: </b>Before we go any further - Hey, Ron, before we press on, would anybody object to me going wide dead band here? Would that affect the comm or anything?</div>
<div><b>134:09:34 CC: </b>Yes, it does, Stu. We talked about that, and you're fat on fuel. So let's stay in narrow dead band here, so we'll keep the comm. You're - -</div>
<div><b>134:09:48 Roosa: </b>Okay - -</div>
<div><b>134:09:49 CC: </b>- - You're about 90 - -</div>
<div><b>134:09:50 Roosa: </b>- - Very good then. I interrupted - -</div>
<div><b>134:09:54 CC: </b>- - You're - -</div>
<div><b>134:09:55 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Ron.</div>
<div><b>134:09:56 CC: </b>- - You're about 90 pounds above the flight plan there.</div>
<div><b>134:10:11 Roosa: </b>Okay. So on this pass I'll try to hit this aim point dead center. Actually, I was under the LMPression that the place we really want to aim is a little to the south and a little to the west from where the center of this is marked here on this map. Why don't you verify that for me, and we'll talk about it when we come around.</div>
<div><b>134:10:36 CC: </b>Okay. Yes, I remember ... talking about it, and I was going to make a little equilateral triangle with those two craters that were right in the -pretty close to the center of the X, you know, just a little bit, like you say, to the south there. And I'll verify that for sure, though.</div>
<div><b>134:10:56 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>134:11:23 CC: </b>And, Stu, here I've got your map update for REV 28 there on page 37-</div>
<div><b>134:11:35 Roosa: </b>Okay. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>134:11:38 CC: </b>Okay. 180 is 135:26:51-</div>
<div><b>134:11:49 Roosa: </b>Okay. 135:26:51, and guess I was talking about this when we went AOS [sic] last time. I - I'm really not - I - I don't need that time. I can -I can find my way around real good. Why don't we just dispense with padding that up and save the chatter?</div>
<div><b>134:12:09 CC: </b>I figured you'd say that. You know we've had real good training on where we are up there so - plus the fact you can whip in the P21 if you really get lost on the thing, so it sounds like a good idea.</div>
<div><b>134:12:31 Roosa: </b>Okay. And do you have data on me now, Ron?</div>
<div><b>134:12:36 CC: </b>That's affirmative. We even have HIGH BIT RATE this time.</div>
<div><b>134:12:45 Roosa: </b>Well, how about that? I know after all this talking and everything, I just happened to look over here. My cabin pressure is - is up. What do you say about it there? I'm reading on the gage here about 5.8 or so.</div>
<div><b>134:13:05 CC: </b>Let me make a quick check with EEC0M.</div>
<div><b>134:13:20 CC: </b>Yes, Stu. You know you pumped it up before you went to bed last night, and the - just the ... accumulator is kind of - you know building it up a little bit. And you just got a real tight cabin. We don't think it's a problem at all.</div>
<div><b>134:13:40 Roosa: </b>Okay. You just don't breathe much when you're in here by yourself, huh?</div>
<div><b>134:13:43 CC: </b>Yes, I guess that's it.</div>
<div><b>134:13:56 CC: </b>And, Stu, go for the point as depicted in the COAS picture.</div>
<div><b>134:14:08 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll put her on there dead center.</div>
<div><b>134:14:11 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>134:14:52 Roosa: </b>Okay, Ron. Just to make sure I understand here now. Really, I won't do anything the way the flight plan is now, until 136 when I go for another Descartes track? You verify that?</div>
<div><b>134:15:09 CC: </b>Yes, that's right. And, let me do some checking here. I don't know if you're going to be able to sneak in any pictures of King, you know, as you're coming up there or not.</div>
<div><b>134:15:26 Roosa: </b>Okay. Well, I'll - I can use the time to get this thing stowed, ready for my hiking buddies.</div>
<div><b>134:15:33 CC: </b>Okay. Speaking of your hiking buddies, they're about - It looks like a little more than halfway back from Cone, heading back toward the LM. Okay. One other flight-plan change I got here on the - -</div>
<div><b>134:15:49 Roosa: </b>Okay. Real fine.</div>
<div><b>134:15:50 CC: </b>- - reference to the batteries. At - Flip over to 137.</div>
<div><b>134:16:05 Roosa: </b>Okay, 137*</div>
<div><b>134:16:07 CC: </b>Okay. And put, "Charge battery A," at that point in time. And take battery B off of charge at that time, instead of at 136:15.</div>
<div><b>134:16:34 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll move "Charge battery A" from 136:15 to 137-</div>
<div><b>134:16:39 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>134:20:34 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston here. You got about a minute to go before you go around the horn.</div>
<div><b>134:20:43 Roosa: </b>Okay. We'll see you in a few minutes.</div>
<div><b>134:20:46 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>134:45:00 : </b>BEGIN LUNAR REV 28</div>
<div><b>135:09:37 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. How we doing?</div>
<div><b>135:09:43 Roosa: </b>Howdy. Getting along real fine.</div>
<div><b>135:09:48 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. We've got you this time, I think.</div>
<div><b>135:10:00 Roosa: </b>Yes. I'm reading you loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>135:10:03 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. We'd like to give the high gain a chance here to do its stuff with the SERVO ELECTRONICS POWER in SECONDARY. So what we'd like to have you do is go to SECONDARY with the HIGH GAIN SERVO ELECTRONICS POWER switch. Switch your - While your TRACK mode in MANUAL, set in a PITCH of minus 58, a YAW of 185, and BEAM WIDTH to WIDE. And then go into a normal acquisition, you know, trying to get it to AUTO and then MEDIUM and then down to NARROW. If for some reason that doesn't work, well then go on back to the way we've been - been doing it there in MANUAL, MEDIUM, and PRIMARY ELECTRONICS.</div>
<div><b>135:11:04 Roosa: </b>Okay. Now, the ELECTRONICS are in SECONDARY now, Ron. They have been since yesterday.</div>
<div><b>135:11:12 CC: </b>Oh, okay. Well, why don't we press on anyhow and try a normal acquisition on the thing, then? Put your PITCH to minus 58, YAW to 185.</div>
<div><b>135:11:22 Roosa: </b>All right.</div>
<div><b>135:11:24 CC: </b>And we'll see if it'll track in AUTO at all, or if it'll - -</div>
<div><b>135:11:27 Roosa: </b>Okay. We'll give it a go.</div>
<div><b>135:11:54 CC: </b>We got NARROW.</div>
<div><b>135:11:57 Roosa: </b>Well, how about that, sports fans! There's AUTO and NARROW, good and solid.</div>
<div><b>135:12:01 CC: </b>Yes. It worked, looks like. Okay. Let's go ahead and leave it there, Stu. And let's see if it'll track when you start to maneuver to the C0AS tracking attitude.</div>
<div><b>135:12:17 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>135:12:59 CC: </b>And, Stu, for your information, A1 and Ed are back at the LM. Al's down there hitting golf balls. Seeing how far he can hit them.</div>
<div><b>135:13:11 Roosa: </b>How's that coming out?</div>
<div><b>135:13:13 CC: </b>A1 - looks like he had. a couple of slices there, but then finally go - got a hold of one and really drove it down the old lunar surface.</div>
<div><b>135:14:00 CC: </b>Stu, you doing anything now? Do you want to talk about these normal docking procedures, changed there on page 52?</div>
<div><b>135:14:12 Roosa: </b>Okay. Just a second. Let me float out from under the couch here and get my book.</div>
<div><b>135:14:17 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>135:14:49 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'm on page 52.</div>
<div><b>135:14:54 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. Let me talk about it here a minute -for a little bit. As you know, normal procedures are we go whipping on in there, we get contact with the drogue, and then, as soon as we get capture, we go to CMC, FREE. Well, the basic difference there is that we want the LM to do a little bit of thrusting. If for some reason, you know, it doesn't go to - the capture light, just don't capture, when you make contact. So, we just want you to press on in there, contact the drogue, and report contact to the LM. And then at that point, the IM is going to do a plus X, And, then as soon as you get capture on the thing, you go to CMC, FREE.</div>
<div><b>135:15:55 CC: </b>So at about 1 ? ?</div>
<div><b>135:15:58 Roosa: </b>Okay. Go ahead, Ron.</div>
<div><b>135:16:06 CC: </b>Okay. Just to have it down in writing there, where it says translate to capture latch at about 144:07 or 08 in there somewhere, change that to, "translate to a contact with drogue."</div>
<div><b>135:16:32 Roosa: </b>Okay. "Translate to contact with drogue."</div>
<div><b>135:16:34 CC: </b>And then add, "report contact to the LM," immediately following that.</div>
<div><b>135:16:47 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll write that down. I'm sure I won't have to tell him.</div>
<div><b>135:16:50 CC: </b>I don't think so either (laughing). But, that's his cue to go ahead and plus-X, if necessary, you know.</div>
<div><b>135:17:03 Roosa: </b>Okay. I've got that - -</div>
<div><b>135:17:04 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>135:17:05 Roosa: </b>- - Translate to contact with drogue, report contact to LM, and CMC, FREE, at capture.</div>
<div><b>135:17:12 CC: </b>Yes. That's right. CMC, FREE, at capture. The thing we didn't want to be is have you in CMC, FREE, and the IM pushing against you, you know? In other words, don't go to CMC, FREE, until you get capture.</div>
<div><b>135:17:28 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>135:17:29 CC: </b>And, that's it.</div>
<div><b>135:17:35 Roosa: </b>Very good.</div>
<div><b>135:22:13 Roosa: </b>..., Ron that S-band's hanging - the antenna's hanging right in there. We should have done that days ago, huh?</div>
<div><b>135:22:18 CC: </b>Yes. It looks like it's done pretty good so far. Let me see how the signal strength's doing with INC0 here.</div>
<div><b>135:22:38 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. It looks like it's tracking okay here. When you lose the high gain, switch to OMNI Delta.</div>
<div><b>135:22:49 Roosa: </b>OMNI Delta.</div>
<div><b>135:22:59 CC: </b>The guys are really having a ball down there on the lunar surface throwing away their tools. Making javelins out of them and everything.</div>
<div><b>135:31:10 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>135:31:15 CC: </b>0k - Okay, Stu. I can just barely read you.</div>
<div><b>135:31:22 Roosa: </b>Disregard me. I was just going to ask you a question about the EVA. I'll catch you later.</div>
<div><b>135:38:00 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. If you read, it's about 30 seconds from T-start time.</div>
<div><b>135:44:00 Roosa: </b>Houston, do you read Kitty Hawk?</div>
<div><b>135:44:02 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk. This is Houston. We?ve got you now.</div>
<div><b>135:44:10 Roosa: </b>Okay. Well, that should have been right on the target, Ron. And my frame counter is 87.</div>
<div><b>135:44:19 CC: </b>Roger. 87 on that one. And while I think about it, on page 35 there, we missed your percent remaining on the galactic survey and lunar libration -camera.</div>
<div><b>135:45:03 Roosa: </b>Okay. After the lunar libration, I'm reading 60 percent.</div>
<div><b>135:45:07 CC: </b>Roger. 60 percent.</div>
<div><b>135:50:27 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Got too much background noise here. We're trying to get the high gain. Can you roll left 60 degrees? And then try to acquire on the HIGH GAIN a PITCH of minus 50, YAW of plus 50.</div>
<div><b>135:50:56 Roosa: </b>Okay. Ron. Let me hold off for about 2 or 3 minutes, if you would, please.</div>
<div><b>135:51:01 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>135:51:10 CC: </b>And then when you get there, we'll be giving you an update, and also I've got some P24 pads for you.</div>
<div><b>135:51:21 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>135:54:40 Roosa: </b>Hey, Ren. Give me those HIGH GAIN angles again.</div>
<div><b>135:55:39 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Those angles were PITCH at minus 50, the YAW at plus 50.</div>
<div><b>135:56:39 Roosa: </b>Houston, you read Kitty Hawk?</div>
<div><b>135:56:41 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston. Man, that's a lot better on the ears, now.</div>
<div><b>135:56:52 CC: </b>Okay; you want to whip it - whip into P00 and ACCEPT, and we'll ship you up a state vector and also a clock SYNC.</div>
<div><b>135:57:06 Roosa: </b>Okay on P00 and ACCEPT.</div>
<div><b>135:57:10 CC: </b>Okay. And you about ready to start copying pads on page 40 there for RP-4?</div>
<div><b>135:57:21 Roosa: </b>I'm ready; go ahead.</div>
<div><b>135:57:22 CC: </b>Okay. Tx, 137:38:43; 43:33; 45:13; 46:01. It's south 02. Ansgarius N, 137:51:34; 56:24; 58:04, 58:52, south 06. Okay, for DE-2, T^, 138:11:23; 16:13; 17=53; l8:41; north 08. Okay, for Encke, E, T , 138:31:14; 36:04; 37:44; 38:32; south 22. And read back.</div>
<div><b>135:59:20 Roosa: </b>Okay, RP-4, 137:38:43; 43:33; 45:13; 46:01; south 02. Ansgarius N, 137:51=34; 56:24; 58:04; 58:52; south 06. 138:11:23; 16:13; 17:53; l8:41; north 08. 138 - Encke E, 138:31:14; 36:04; 37:44; 38:32; south 22.</div>
<div><b>136:00:20 CC: </b>Beautiful readback there, Stu.</div>
<div><b>136:00:26 Roosa: </b>Okay, we're all set.</div>
<div><b>136:00:30 CC: </b>And A1 and Ed are back in the LM, now.</div>
<div><b>136:00:41 Roosa: </b>How many golf balls did A1 have with him?</div>
<div><b>136:00:45 CC: </b>Well, I thought I saw three real good swings, there.</div>
<div><b>136:00:52 Roosa: </b>Great.</div>
<div><b>136:00:55 CC: </b>And, Kitty Hawk; Houston. The computer is yours.</div>
<div><b>136:01:02 Roosa: </b>Okay. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>136:02:19 CC: </b>Hey, Kitty Hawk; Houston.</div>
<div><b>136:02:24 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>136:02:26 CC: </b>We noticed - maybe a little more fuel usage there. Did possibly you hit a couple of DIRECT switches maybe? On that COAS target or something?</div>
<div><b>136:02:39 Roosa: </b>Yes.</div>
<div><b>136:02:40 CC: </b>Yes.</div>
<div><b>136:02:41 Roosa: </b>Yes, I did. The - You need three hands to get that going where you've got one hand on that fool camera control and then to throw the switch; so, I was taking a couple of pictures and I used the DIRECT for a little bit there.</div>
<div><b>136:02:57 CC: </b>Okay, that clears it up. I figured that maybe what it might have been and just wanted to check.</div>
<div><b>136:03:49 CC: </b>And, Kitty Hawk; Houston. If you want to dig out your G&C Checklist there, on page G9-4, I got a couple of constants to change there in that erasable load.</div>
<div><b>136:04:18 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'm ready to copy.</div>
<div><b>136:04:21 CC: </b>Okay. On page G9-4, column Delta, line 10, change it from 02210; change it to 02263*</div>
<div><b>136:04:49 Roosa: </b>Okay, 9-4, under Delta, line 10, now reads 02263.</div>
<div><b>136:04:57 CC: </b>Okay, and then on line 11, same column, Delta, change it from 36321; change it to 15472.</div>
<div><b>136:05:16 Roosa: </b>Okay. 15472 for Delta, line 11.</div>
<div><b>136:05:22 CC: </b>Okay. And these are those - the erasable locations that we changed yesterday on the thrust model, you know.</div>
<div><b>136:05:31 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>136:05:46 CC: </b>Hey, Stu, just out of curiosity, when you whipped by Lansberg Bravo there, did you get - you think you got some 250-millimeter pictures of that area? You know when you had the long pass?</div>
<div><b>136:06:03 Roosa: </b>Yes. Yes, I should have got some - some good ones of Lansberg B.</div>
<div><b>136:06:10 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>136:06:11 Roosa: </b>It was - They were 500.</div>
<div><b>136:06:14 CC: </b>Oh, okay. Beautiful.</div>
<div><b>136:07:35 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. You can go ahead and whip into vide dead band there for a while, if you want. It looks like we've got a good high gain now.</div>
<div><b>136:07:47 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>136:07:49 CC: </b>And also, in looking through this P24 there, it looks like we're changing the shutter speeds on each one of those things for the DAC. Just a reminder.</div>
<div><b>136:08:02 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>136:08:38 CC: </b>And, Stu, just for a matter of information here on further planning, right now we're looking at REV 30 - where we've got our zero-phase things -the forwards and backwards. And we'll probably go ahead and do the backwards zero phase, but not the forward, and do another C0AS maneuver on the Descartes area.</div>
<div><b>136:09:06 Roosa: </b>Okay. Sounds good.</div>
<div><b>136:09:20 CC: </b>And if you got a half a minute here, you might pull out your Descartes C0AS picture again, and I can explain your aim point for that pass.</div>
<div><b>136:09:36 Roosa: </b>Okay. I've got it right here.</div>
<div><b>136:09:38 CC: </b>Okay. As you look at the page, you've got a picture of the C0AS in there. And - on the east side, or toward the bottom of the page, you can see a little doublet about 1 and - 1 and a half marks or 1 and a third marks down from the center of the COAS. Right on the vertical COAS line.</div>
<div><b>136:10:13 Roosa: </b>Yes. I've got that.</div>
<div><b>136:10:16 CC: </b>Okay. It's just east - -</div>
<div><b>136:10:19 Roosa: </b>Is that the aim point?</div>
<div><b>136:10:20 CC: </b>That's the aim point, by golly.</div>
<div><b>136:10:27 Roosa: </b>What are we doing way over there?</div>
<div><b>136:10:29 CC: </b>Well, it's just a little further east than the two bright craters, you know.</div>
<div><b>136:10:38 Roosa: </b>Okay. Yes.</div>
<div><b>136:10:46 CC: </b>And - -</div>
<div><b>136:10:47 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll make that the aim point.</div>
<div><b>136:10:48 CC: </b>Okay. See, and then you started out a little bit west of the aim point on the map, and then we got one right at the aim point. And then we're getting these just a little further east, so we'll have some stereostrips quite a ways through the area there.</div>
<div><b>136:11:30 CC: </b>Okay. Another thing, Kitty Hawk. To help balance the quads a little bit there, you can whip back into VERB 48 there and use Bravo Delta for roll.</div>
<div><b>136:11:47 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>136:13:25 CC: </b>Hey, Stu. You might like to know - I don't know where they're going to put all those rocks they found down there on the surface, but the LM was full, so you better find a place for them.</div>
<div><b>136:13:41 Roosa: </b>Yes. That's what I been doing, is trying to get things organized for the avalanche.</div>
<div><b>136:13:46 CC: </b>(Laughter ) Okay.</div>
<div><b>136:18:13 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>136:18:18 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>136:18:21 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. We got about 2 minutes until LOS here. Just for a little bit of advance planning, we're pretty sure we'd like to bring the probe back with you. So - and right now we're thinking about stashing it down there between A-6 and A-10, you know, down betw - betw - below the LMP's couch there somewhere.</div>
<div><b>136:18:59 Roosa: </b>Okay. Well, you know that - Okay. You know, you don't put the probe between A-6 and A-10, you know; it goes on top of A-10.</div>
<div><b>136:19:13 CC: </b>(Laughter) Yes, I know, Stu. It's - I don't know - it's - We'll work out the stowage down there. But it looks like maybe you can stick the point, you know, down in there somewhere, or at least get part of it down between the two of them. And I realize there isn't much room. It'll be mostly on top.</div>
<div><b>136:19:42 Roosa: </b>Yes, that ought to take care of the L-over-D problem.</div>
<div><b>136:19:45 CC: </b>Yes. RETRO's kind of happy about that.</div>
<div><b>136:44:00 : </b>BEGIN LUNAR REV 29</div>
<div><b>137:09:19 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. We've got you on LOW BIT RATE now. Lot of background noise here, and I probably won't be able to hear you very much, but you're in a - an - a not - not-as-good high-gain antenna attitude. .</div>
<div><b>137:09:40 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>137:10:56 CC: </b>And, Kitty Hawk; Houston. I show you about 30 seconds from T^ on the Ansgarius N.</div>
<div><b>137:11:06 Roosa: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>137:15:35 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Time to start your camera and shutter speed should be l/250th.</div>
<div><b>137:35:05 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. I missed your T^ time call there; but it's time to start the camera, now, on EE-2.</div>
<div><b>137:41:57 Roosa: </b>Okay, Houston. Kitty Hawk. I'll give you those gyro torquing angles in a minute.</div>
<div><b>137:42:12 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. You can try it. I might be able to copy them.</div>
<div><b>137:42:21 Roosa: </b>I'll catch you in about 2 or 3 minutes, Ron.</div>
<div><b>137:42:24 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>137:51:04 Roosa: </b>Well, I - Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>137:51:09 CC: </b>Okay. You're way down in the mud there, Kitty Hawk, but go.</div>
<div><b>137:51:15 Roosa: </b>Okay. I saw the LM again when I went across them.</div>
<div><b>137:51:22 CC: </b>Hey, by golly. That's amazing; that?s great.</div>
<div><b>137:51:29 Roosa: </b>Yes. It's a little harder without the long shadow that it was putting out yesterday. I - what I was doing was just playing around. I should have been gotten P24 and marked on it, but that was a good mark that I - I mean a good pass that I had yesterday.</div>
<div><b>137:51:46 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>137:51:50 CC: </b>Hi, Stu.</div>
<div><b>137:51:55 Roosa: </b>Hi, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>137:51:57 CC: </b>I haven't got to talk to you in a couple of days.</div>
<div><b>137:52:04 Roosa: </b>Well, you've been tied up.</div>
<div><b>137:52:08 CC: </b>Yes. Just a little bit.</div>
<div><b>137:55:31 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. The camera ought to be running.</div>
<div><b>138:04:51 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk. The lack of noise is music to my ears.</div>
<div><b>138:04:59 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>138:05:02 CC: </b>And - -</div>
<div><b>138:05:03 Roosa: </b>Looks like you have a good lockup here.</div>
<div><b>138:05:05 CC: </b>Yes, It's working fine. And we?re standing by for your magazine percentage and also your P52.</div>
<div><b>138:05:14 Roosa: </b>Okay. The magazine percentage is 35*</div>
<div><b>138:05:19 CC: </b>Roger; 35.</div>
<div><b>138:05:21 Roosa: </b>And, let me find my P52.</div>
<div><b>138:06:10 Roosa: </b>And, the P52, if you're ready.</div>
<div><b>138:06:13 CC: </b>Ready to copy.</div>
<div><b>138:06:17 Roosa: </b>Okay. Minus 00.002, minus 00,166, minus 00.005; torque at 137:18:00.</div>
<div><b>138:06:37 CC: </b>Do you want to talk about your NOUN 05 today?</div>
<div><b>138:06:44 Roosa: </b>No, I had all zeros on this one.</div>
<div><b>138:06:48 CC: </b>I figured as much. Okay. We copy: minus ,002, minus .166, and a minus .005; torque's at 137:18:00</div>
<div><b>138:07:06 Roosa: </b>Roger. Hey, is Fredo still there?</div>
<div><b>138:07:13 CC: </b>Yes, wait 1. He's talking to the "LMies" right now.</div>
<div><b>138:07:17 Roosa: </b>No, that's all right - that's all right. I was just - you know, not only seeing Lhe LM, I saw the Sun glinting off the ALSEP, I?m sure. And I was just wondering if it was deployed out by that crater at about CL 0.8 or 85/65.</div>
<div><b>138:07:44 CC: </b>Okay. I got a map here. Looks like it was about pretty close to CR and 63, is the ALSEP.</div>
<div><b>138:07:59 Roosa: </b>C what?</div>
<div><b>138:08:01 CC: </b>Charlie-Romeo and 63. It's really Charlie-Quebec 0.9 and about a 63.2.</div>
<div><b>138:08:22 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>138:08:36 CC: </b>Where did you say you thought you saw a bright spot there?</div>
<div><b>138:08:42 Roosa: </b>Well, now, I'm wondering if I got my direction from the LM - you can get the LM because it's by the Triplet.</div>
<div><b>138:08:52 CC: </b>Right.</div>
<div><b>138:08:53 Roosa: </b>And, I just looked out and saw the bright spot going toward - parked out by another crater. And I'm thinking maybe I got my directions from the LM wrong. Is ALSEP out by that crater called Neighbor on the map?</div>
<div><b>138:09:16 CC: </b>Wait a minute; I don't have Neighbor on this particular map I'm looking at. ALSEP is kind of between Doublet and Triplet, if you can see that part of it there. And, it's toward Doublet from the LM.</div>
<div><b>138:09:34 Roosa: </b>Yes, well that's where I called - that's where I said the first time, and it didn't fit in. You told me Charlie-Quebec 0.9*</div>
<div><b>138:09:45 CC: </b>Wait 1, Stu, until I get the right - same map you're looking at.</div>
<div><b>138:10:11 CC: </b>Okay. I was looking at a smaller map. It's got some more numbers in there. You're right. It's really right there by Neighbor, just east - just south of Neighbor. It's right in a line between the center crater of Triplet and Doublet.</div>
<div><b>138:10:53 Roosa: </b>Well, now, the coordinates that I called the first time just - you know, I didn't compare the map when I was looking through the sextant, but it looked to me like the - just judging on here, the ALSEP would be about CL 0.9 and right at 65, maybe 64.9. And, see, there's a little crater. See that little crater right there at about CL 8 and maybe 64 -64.5, or something like that.</div>
<div><b>138:11:34 CC: </b>Okay. Yes, I think that - I think that was the ALSEP --</div>
<div><b>138:11:36 Roosa: </b>Yes, I think right there is - Yes. I can see the Sun shining off the beauty.</div>
<div><b>138:11:42 CC: </b>Yes. That was it; that was it.</div>
<div><b>138:12:15 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk there. Maybe we ought to whip into the update - map update or the flight-plan update for the next REV. And we'11 start out with the zero-phase pad backward on page 43.</div>
<div><b>138:12:28 Roosa: </b>And, Houston; Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>138:12:31 CC: </b>Houston, go.</div>
<div><b>138:12:36 Roosa: </b>Okay, Ron. Where we going to do - we going to have the first zero phase and then shoot Descartes?</div>
<div><b>138:12:43 CC: </b>That's affirm.</div>
<div><b>138:12:48 Roosa: </b>Okay. Sounds like a good idea.</div>
<div><b>138:12:54 CC: </b>Yes, it ought to be pretty good. And for the zero-phase backward pad, roll angle is 195.4; pitch, 344.4; yaw, 359-9- T-start, 139:41:42. You write down your switch time - is 758. And, just a note - -</div>
<div><b>138:13:41 Roosa: </b>Okay. 195.4 -</div>
<div><b>138:13:46 CC: </b>Just a note there, Stu. When you start the DAC and stop the DAC, give a call so we can get a time hack on it.</div>
<div><b>138:14:04 Roosa: </b>Okay. 195.4, 344.4, 359-9, 139=41:42. Switch is 758, and I give you a mark for start and stop of the DAC on the camera.</div>
<div><b>138:14:20 CC: </b>Okay. Mighty fine. And, at the bottom of the page there on - at 140, add a VERB 49 maneuver. VERB 49 to a roll, 028; pitch, 253; and yaw, 0. That's to the C0AS striking attitude.</div>
<div><b>138:14:53 Roosa: </b>Okay. 140, a VERB 49 to 028, 253, and 0 degrees.</div>
<div><b>138:15:00 CC: </b>And, as you notice, you got a little bit of roll in there; so, you ought to have fun tracking this one with a little pitch and yaw, minimum LMPulse, you know.</div>
<div><b>138:15:11 Roosa: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>138:15:12 CC: </b>Okay. On page 44, got a little deletion there. Delete the VERB 49 at the top of the page, there. Say goodbye to Isadora and Compella; delete phototarget 7, there. And, in all that place in there, put the 500-millimeter procedures. And, at 140:15, put your T-start time of 140:15=13. And, then, you can go ahead and delete the zero-phase observations forward looking - which is kind of the rest of the page, there.</div>
<div><b>138:16:20 Roosa: </b>Roger. It looks like we?ll just delete everything else.</div>
<div><b>138:16:23 CC: </b>Yes, that's right. And the target point for that one is, as we mentioned before, you know about one and a third of those marks down the COAS, east of the depicted COAS position there.</div>
<div><b>138:16:45 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll try to pick up that little Doublet there.</div>
<div><b>138:16:49 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>138:17:54 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk. We got about 1 minute to LOS here. A1 and Ed are completing a debriefing from their EVA. And I think they had - got about 160 pounds of stuff - 167 pounds of stuff coming back up to you.</div>
<div><b>138:18:18 Roosa: </b>Jolly good.</div>
<div><b>138:18:20 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>138:18:23 Roosa: </b>160 pounds of rocks and a probe, huh?</div>
<div><b>138:18:27 CC: </b>Yes. You betcha.</div>
<div><b>138:19:00 : </b>BEGIN LUNAR REV 30</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>139:03:02 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay. We're getting ready to start the zero-phase observations on targets 5 and 6. We're a minute and a half past the T-start time; waiting for 5 minutes - to put on the camera.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>139:03:25 Roosa (onboard): </b>Passed over target 1.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>139:03:36 Roosa (onboard): </b>Sure is a lot of difference with this low Sun than there was yesterday. Kind of amazing about C; how - in particular, how it - You really lose it at zero-phase,</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>139:05:20 Roosa (onboard): </b>Well, tell you what. At this low - Sun angle, you can see a B on target 2, but it's still - still almost unidentifiable; that's just really a tough target. A shows up real well at this low Sun angle You'd be hard put to call which crater was B - at any Sun angle.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>139:06:02 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay, At 04:20, turning on the DAC here shortly. Camera ...</div>
<div><b>139:06:17 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston here, if you read. You got less than 30 seconds to start your camera for zero phase.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>139:11:13 Roosa (onboard): </b>And I lost them all - So on that one, at the switch point, I could not pick up target A at all. It was just too subdued. B was easy to pick up, and 0 also. C - C was - was very easy to pick up. Going through zero-phase, B was completely wiped out; A, I never did have to start with, so it was wiped out; and C - C held through zero-phase and reasonably well; but as it got further on up, it, too, got pretty well wiped out. I think it's the same bit of being on the - being on the backside. You Just - The terrain is - You don't have the flat mare surface to give you the relief that - that you need to pick out - to pick out the targets. It's - what - very little contrast In albedo, and -you - you Just don't have the - the ability to see the darks and lights like we did on the frontside pass yesterday. And, I guess, in summary now, for targets 3 - very easy to pick up at the time I picked them up; of course, the Sun was low on them. And I'm going to turn off this ... test lever under panel 18. Okay, I'll leave it on a little longer and debrief onto the tape. A - A, B, and C on target 3 picked up very easily. Saw them into zero-phase; surpri - B is a fairly shallow crater, but it even held up as good as C. I'd put 3 and C both completely wiped out at zero-phase. A held to zero-phase; but then, as it went on up, you surely couldn't have picked it up - by itself, if you didn't know the relation to some other terrain. All three of those were - Once you're well past zero-phase, it'd be a rather marginal target. And, on target 6, I never got A at all - it was already wiped out. B went real fast in zero-phase approach. C, you could still identify after zero-phase, but Just because you knew it was there. And then, it</div>
<div><b>139:15:23 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, this is Houston. We got too much background noise again. I can't read you.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>139:15:31 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay. Let me see if I can pick up the high gain,</div>
<div><b>139:15:32 Roosa: </b>Okay. Let me see if I can pick up the HIGH GAIN.</div>
<div><b>139:15:40 CC: </b>No. I just can't make you out. Maybe you can get me on the HIGH GAIN there.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>139:15:48 Roosa (onboard): </b>It ought to be getting better real fast.</div>
<div><b>139:15:48 Roosa: </b>It ought to be getting better real fast.</div>
<div><b>139:15:52 CC: </b>Hey. By golly. That's much better.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>139:15:57 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay. And stand by Just 1; I'll make - I want to mate a couple of notes here. And - -</div>
<div><b>139:15:58 Roosa: </b>Okay. And stand by just 1. I'll make a - I want to make a couple of notes here.</div>
<div><b>139:16:02 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>139:16:04 Roosa: </b>And you - you've got the tape back again. I hit COMMAND RESET there so I could get - keep the tape running. I don't know when it went off during the pass.</div>
<div><b>139:16:13 CC: </b>Okay. We copy.</div>
<div><b>139:18:20 Roosa: </b>Okay, Ron. I'm back with you.</div>
<div><b>139:18:24 CC: </b>Roger. Go ahead, Stu, with your frame number and whatever. I mean your percent. No, I was right the first time, frame number.</div>

<div><b>139:46:37 Roosa: </b>Houston, Kitty Hawk.</div>
<div><b>139:46:39 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk. Go - a little background noise, but go ahead. You're good shape now. Background noise is from the LM.</div>
<div><b>139:46:55 Roosa: </b>How about that? Okay. The tracking went pretty good. It's getting at - this Sun angle at the - I didn't pick up at Doublet. However, I knew where it should be, and I got another little one in that area. So I think the track is pretty close to the - the area you wanted. The track - the tracking went all right. However, in the heat of the battle there, I did not get the tape recorder going, so we didn't get the HIGH BIT RATE on that track. And the frame number is 126.</div>
<div><b>139:47:42 CC: </b>Okay. We copy that, Stu. And don't leave the dark slide out of that magazine when you take it off. Okay? It's a pretty LMPortant magazine.</div>
<div><b>139:47:55 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>

<div><b>139:57:49 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>139:59:07 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. We've got a few more things to go on the uplink there. Can you still give us P00 and ACCEPT?</div>
<div><b>139:59:17 Roosa: </b>Roger. You've still got it.</div>
<div><b>140:02:13 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Computer is yours.</div>
<div><b>140:02:20 Roosa: </b>Okay. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>140:04:01 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. I've got your ascent pads for you.</div>
<div><b>140:04:17 Roosa: </b>Okay. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>140:04:19 CC: </b>Okay. Direct ascent rendezvous pad: GETI of lift-off, 142:25:42.00; NOUN 37; 143:10:54.00. And the T. for one REV late: lift-off is ig 142:24:04. Okay. Your coelliptic rendezvous -Oh, wait a minute. I'm sorry. CSM weight: 34417. Coelliptic rendezvous pad: lift-off T is 142:28:12.50; CSI, 143:26:36.60; NOUN 37; 145:11:30.00. And ready for readback.</div>
<div><b>140:05:39 Roosa: </b>Okay. Copy. Direct ascent - oh, before I start, give me that - that for one - one REV late. What - what T. do you have there? ig</div>
<div><b>140:05:51 CC: </b>Okay. That's just set the lift-off for one REV late. Wait a minute. Hold it. That's the wrong number. For some reason, it doesn't match up here.</div>
<div><b>140:06:05 Roosa: </b>That's what I was thinking.</div>
<div><b>140:06:07 CC: </b>Yes. You're right. Okay, Copied it down wrong. Sorry. Okay, T^ for one REV late is 144:24:04.</div>
<div><b>140:06:51 Roosa: </b>Okay. Direct ascent: 142:25:42.00; 143:10:54.00; lift-off one REV late: 144 plus 24 plus 04. CSM weight, 34417. Coelliptic: 142:28:12.50; 143:26:36.60; 145:11:30.00.</div>
<div><b>140:07:06 CC: </b>Okay. Good readback, Kitty Hawk. And we probably won't have MSFN relay the next time you come around here. As a matter of fact, I Just got the word, we will not have any MSFN relay when you come around the next time.</div>
<div><b>140:07:27 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>140:13:19 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. We have your torquing angles.</div>
<div><b>140:13:27 Roosa: </b>Okay. Torqued at 140:53:20.</div>
<div><b>140:13:32 CC: </b>Roger. 53 at 20.</div>
<div><b>140:15:46 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. About 1 minute to LOS there. All systems are GO, and we'll see you coming around the other side.</div>
<div><b>140:15:57 Roosa: </b>Kitty Hawk, Roger.</div>
<div><b>140:41:00 : </b>BEGIN LUNAR REV 31</div>
<div><b>141:04:59 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Are you having an SOS sandwich there for lunch?</div>
<div><b>141:05:06 Roosa: </b>Not quite, but I sure wish it was.</div>
<div><b>141:05:09 CC: </b>(Laughter) Okay. When you get a chance there, Stu, you can go ahead and terminate BAT A charge.</div>
<div><b>141:05:21 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll do it right now.</div>
<div><b>141:05:24 CC: </b>Okay. And while you're floating over there, you might be advised that the TPI DELTA-V will probably be - more than likely be - around 100 feet a second instead of about 90 or so, you know?</div>
<div><b>141:05:41 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>141:05:47 CC: </b>And your ascent pads are good the way they are.</div>
<div><b>141:05:55 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>141:05:56 CC: </b>Antares is pressing on in good shape there. They're getting set for the liftoff, about 39 minutes yet. And, as you might notice here, we're on separate air-to-ground loops. So I'll be talking to you through this pass, and I'll relay all information on up to you. When you go to the P20 attitude, the OMNI antennas just make all kinds of noise racket down here, so I may not be able to hear you, but I think you've been hearing me most of the time. So I'll Just go ahead and relay, probably in the blind, most of the time line.</div>
<div><b>141:06:37 Roosa: </b>All right.</div>
<div><b>141:10:55 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston.</div>
<div><b>141:10:59 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>141:11:01 CC: </b>Okay, Stu, we're going to bring the probe back with us, or you guys are, anyhow. And for TEI, just go ahead and stow it underneath the right-hand couch - you know, with the straps like we normally do, there, for temporary storage. And then, on the way - -</div>
<div><b>141:11:23 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>141:11:24 CC: </b>- - back, we?ll give you some permanent stowage instructions, during transearth coast. Also, your VHF acquisition time - that's when you come over the horizon for the VHF there - will be 142:20:18.</div>
<div><b>141:11:55 Roosa: </b>Okay, 142:20:18; and, Ron, I'm going to be off the comm here, probably about 4 or 5 minutes.</div>
<div><b>141:12:03 CC: </b>Okay; understand.</div>
<div><b>141:15:45 Roosa: </b>Okay, Ron; I'm back on.</div>
<div><b>141:15:48 CC: </b>Okay; mighty fine, Stu.</div>
<div><b>141:22:40 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. It looks like you're getting about ready to maneuver, there. Just want to let you know the LM's in good shape. About the only thing that's even pending is the - their steerable antenna, and it looks like it may not be tracking correctly on the thing. So they may be using their OMNI antennas.</div>
<div><b>141:23:04 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>141:23:24 Roosa: </b>Okay, thank you, Ron. We'll see you on OMNI Delta, here.</div>
<div><b>141:23:29 CC: </b>Okay. You may see me; I won't see you. We?ll hope, maybe it'll work. Hey, by the way, that's a beautiful job whipping around out there - we got some real good selenodetic updates, and I'm sure we got a bunch of good pictures, by golly.</div>
<div><b>141:23:48 Roosa: </b>Thank you.</div>
<div><b>141:29:33 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. The APS is pressurized. Antares has a GO for lift-off; direct rendezvous on this pass.</div>
<div><b>141:29:45 Roosa: </b>Roger. Thank you, Ron.</div>
<div><b>141:29:50 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>141:54:54 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Are you copying the LM VHF?</div>
<div><b>141:55:20 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative, Ron. I am reading them loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>141:55:22 CC: </b>Okay. Mighty fine. And, Kitty Hawk; Houston. There will be a tweak burn.</div>
<div><b>141:55:37 Roosa: </b>Understand. There will be a tweak.</div>
<div><b>141:55:39 CC: </b>Affirmative.</div>
<div><b>141:58:36 CC: </b>Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston. You're GO for a direct rendezvous.</div>
<div><b>142:00:19 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston; we're still checking your vector. You're not ...</div>
<div><b>142:00:27 Roosa: </b>Okay, I was just going to start on that when I got a GO on it. Pfy- VHF won't stay locked on, Ron. It'll just flash me a RANGE and then drop right back off again. Anybody got any good ideas?</div>
<div><b>142:00:43 CC: </b>Okay, let me check the - You say your VHF won't stay locked on. It locks on and then comes right back out again. Is that correct?</div>
<div><b>142:00:53 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative. It just flashes me a RANGE and then drops right back to zero.</div>
<div><b>142:00:59 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>142:01:54 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. LM update - or LM state vector update is not required. You're GO the way it is. And any better luck on the VHF?</div>
<div><b>142:02:09 Roosa: </b>Okay. No, it's still the same.</div>
<div><b>142:02:25 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. I just can't read you.</div>
<div><b>142:02:54 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Transmitting kind of in the blind here, because I can't read you; but go ahead and try to take the VHF monitor, and see if you get a tracking light or not.</div>
<div><b>142:03:07 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative. I do.</div>
<div><b>142:03:31 CC: </b>And, Kitty Hawk; you want to be sure and make sure that the Antares remains quiet on the VHF there while we're trying to lock up on the thing.</div>
<div><b>142:05:20 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. It looks like the VHF may have - may have locked up after your NOUN 49 value you had on it.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>142:05:34 Roosa (onboard): </b></div>
<div><b>142:05:34 Roosa: </b>Yes. It's going okay.</div>

<div><b>142:10:07 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Your vehicle's in good shape. You've got about 5 minutes to LOS here. And, Stu, you're accepting all the optics monitor in good shape. You probably better go ahead and accept the VHF monitor, also.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>142:11:13 Shepard (onboard): </b>Okay....</div>

<div class="onboard"><b>142:11:44 Roosa (onboard): </b>Okay. I've already ... one.</div>
<div><b>142:11:44 Roosa: </b>Okay. You say reinitialize? I've already accepted one.</div>
<div><b>142:12:05 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, don't worry about the W-matrix on the ground. Just press on. Accept sextant marks only.</div>
<div><b>142:12:16 Roosa: </b>It's too late. I?ve already Initialized it.</div>

<div><b>143:09:49 Mitchell-LM: </b>The line of sight through the COAS looks real good.</div>
<div><b>143:10:17 CC: </b>Okay Stu, we're getting a great TV signal now.</div>
<div><b>143:10:23 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll try a little zoom. I don?t know if you can pick him up yet or not.</div>
<div><b>143:10:33 CC: </b>Okay, can you tell us roughly where he is in the monitor and grid coordinates?</div>
<div><b>143:11:04 Roosa: </b>He's right on the top of B and C. On the line in between them it looks like, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>143:11:12 CC: </b>Roger. Is that B-2 and -3?</div>
<div><b>143:11:18 Roosa: </b>Well, let me see. I can't see that far over to the monitor. Let me take another look.</div>
<div><b>143:11:23 CC: </b>Oh, don't worry about it.</div>
<div><b>143:11:24 Roosa: </b>I'll look out the window here first.</div>
<div><b>143:11:37 CC: </b>Okay. We've got it now.</div>
<div><b>143:11:52 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. We've got him at the left-hand edge of our picture about one-third of the way down from the top. Growing bigger every second.</div>
<div><b>143:12:04 Roosa: </b>Okay. Roger.</div>
<div><b>143:14:02 Roosa: </b>Looking mighty pretty. No sweat.</div>
<div><b>143:14:36 Roosa: </b>Okay, I believe I'll just have a few pictures of you here.</div>
<div><b>143:15:20 Roosa: </b>You've lost a little weight since the last time I saw you.</div>
<div><b>143:16:04 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>143:16:57 Shepard-LM: </b>Houston, Antares is stationkeeping at about 100 feet. Closing in a little more for the pictures of the service module and command module.</div>
<div><b>143:17:04 Roosa: </b>Roger, Al. We've got you on television, and It's looking beautiful.</div>
<div><b>143:17:19 Roosa: </b>Okay, anytime you?re ready Al, you -</div>
<div><b>143:17:24 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay, we've got you Stu. Go ahead and turn it around, we'll photograph you.</div>
<div><b>143:17:27 CC: </b>Say, Stu - -</div>
<div><b>143:17:28 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'm going to turn the TV oir here.</div>
<div><b>143:17:29 CC: </b>- - Stu, looking at the ascent stage of the LM, it looks like there's something hanging loose from the bottom of it. A piece of wire or insulation or anything. Any comment on that?</div>
<div><b>143:17:43 Roosa: </b>Yes, I saw that. I was going to wait until we got in a little closer. Probably part of the separation plane, I'm sure.</div>
<div><b>143:17:49 CC: </b>Yes, we - we concur on that.</div>
<div><b>143:17:50 Roosa: </b>Let me turn the TV out here before I blast it into the Sun on this pitcharound, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>143:17:54 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>143:18:05 CC: </b>And, Stu, we'd like to confirm that you got the LM weight of 5T00 pounds loaded in the DAP prior to the docking.</div>
<div><b>143:18:15 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>143:18:19 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay, I see a smooth loop there.</div>
<div><b>143:18:21 Roosa: </b>That's no problem, Bruce. Because I dock and I'll go FREE, and then I'll get all that squared away, but I'll load it in.</div>
<div><b>143:18:30 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>143:18:31 Roosa: </b>Okay. Stand by 1 here. Okay, I shall do a loop, leader.</div>
<div><b>143:18:41 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay, make it smooth.</div>
<div><b>143:18:46 Roosa: </b>And around we go.</div>
<div><b>143:18:48 Shepard-LM: </b>Show us a little style. Oh, you look good.</div>
<div><b>143:18:57 Roosa.: </b>There I was at 240,000 coming over the top.</div>
<div><b>143:19:03 Mitchell-LM: </b>That's our home away from home.</div>
<div><b>143:19:16 CC: </b>Would you believe 360,000?</div>
<div><b>143:19:23 Mitchell-LM: </b>Yes.</div>
<div><b>143:19:31 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay, Houston. Kitty Hawk is doing an extremely smooth loop. We're sitting at 70 feet watching him go around. He looks very clean. Engine ... looks very clean - - ...</div>
<div><b>143:21:56 Shepard-LM: </b>Oh, you look clean. Nice and clean, Stu.</div>
<div><b>143:22:09 Mitchell-LM: </b>Want to colo in a little closer? It'll save you some gas.</div>
<div><b>143:22:24 CC: </b>Ed, this is Houston. When you get a chance, on panel 16, would you check the ASA - AEA circuit breakers. We've lost data from the AEA only. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:22:40 Mitchell-LM: </b>They're both in.</div>
<div><b>143:22:41 CC: </b>Thank you.</div>
<div><b>143:22:44 Shepard-LM: </b>That close enough?</div>
<div><b>143:22:48 Roosa: </b>Yes, that ought to do it.</div>
<div><b>143:23:21 Roosa: </b>Okay, I've got the stationkeeping. Houston, what that is trailing is a little bit of that foil on the bottom part of that tank area, there.</div>
<div><b>143:23:42 CC: </b>Thank you, Stu.</div>
<div><b>143:23:45 Roosa: </b>Looks like during separation, the foil - that insulation got - got ripped. The other side is down tight. And the side you're looking at there is ripped out pretty badly.</div>
<div><b>143:23:58 CC: </b>Roger. Thank you, Stu. And we got a real good TV picture.</div>
<div><b>143:25:15 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>143:25:40 CC: </b>Aiitares, this is Houston. Request LO BIT RATE, APT1 OMNI. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:25:45 Roosa: </b>You want L0 BIT RATE, AFT OMNI? Let's see, I wouldn't come in much closer than that, Al. Aren't you going to dp your roll? Okay. Yes.</div>
<div><b>143:26:06 Shepard-LM: </b>Okay, I'm starting my roll.</div>
<div><b>143:26:15 Mitchell-LM: </b>Houston, Antares. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>143:27:01 Roosa: </b>Okay, why don't you Just stop it there. I need to translate down and right, here. Okay.</div>
<div><b>143:27:08 CC: </b>And, Kitty Hawk, we show you - -</div>
<div><b>143:27:10 Mitchell-LM: </b>Houston, Antares. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:27:15 CC: </b>- - P47 for the docking. Go ahead, Antares.</div>
<div><b>143:27:20 Roosa: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>143:27:21 Mitchell-LM: </b>Roger. You're on the OMNIs and be advised I seem to have lost AGSs, although I have no warning.</div>
<div><b>143:27:27 CC: </b>Roger, Ed. We copy.</div>
<div><b>143:27:30 Roosa: </b>Okay, Houston. I have a - Houston, I have the LOGIC ON and would like a GO for PYR0 ARM.</div>
<div><b>143:27:46 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston, You're GO for PYRO ARM.</div>
<div><b>143:27:53 Roosa: </b>Okay. They're coming on.</div>
<div><b>143:28:13 CC: </b>Antares, this is Houston. We'd like to get the steerable up. PITCH, 170; YAW, plus 55; HIGH BIT RATE and request that you and Kitty Hawk do not make contact until we establish good telemetry. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:28:33 Mitchell-LM: </b>Roger; Ed. Steerable up. Say again ... just a second.</div>
<div><b>143:28:37 CC: </b>Okay. PITCH, 170; YAW, plus 55, Ed. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:29:00 Roosa: </b>Say again.</div>
<div><b>143:29:04 Mitchell-LM: </b>Houston, we're locked up. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>143:29:06 CC: </b>Roger. Loud and clear, Ed, and we got HIGH BIT RATE.</div>
<div><b>143:29:12 Mitchell-LM: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>143:29:38 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. You're GO for the docking.</div>
<div><b>143:29:46 Mitchell-LM: </b>Roger. We got you.</div>
<div><b>143:29:52 Roosa: </b>Yes. How about that?</div>
<div><b>143:31:53 Roosa: </b>Say again.</div>
<div><b>143:32:33 Roosa: </b>Okay, we capture.</div>
<div><b>143:32:39 CC: </b>Beautiful. Normal docking.</div>
<div><b>143:32:54 Roosa: </b>Okay. And we got hard dock.</div>
<div><b>143:32:56 CC: </b>Beautiful. There's a big sigh of relief being breathed around here.</div>
<div><b>143:33:07 Shepard: </b>All over the world, there is.</div>
<div><b>143:33:08 Roosa: </b>You ought to try it from up here.</div>
<div><b>143:33:11 CC: </b>This world and out of this world, too.</div>
<div><b>143:33:28 Roosa: </b>Let me - let me clean up over here and I'll be -</div>
<div><b>143:33:42 CC: </b>Antares, Houston. When you have a moment, go to P00 and DATA for us, and we've got an uplink for you. Good.</div>
<div><b>143:33:58 Shepard: </b>Okay. You have it, Houston.</div>
<div><b>143:34:01 CC: </b>Thank you.</div>
<div><b>143:34:07 Mitchell: </b>Houston, are you going to give me the LM - command module weight?</div>
<div><b>143:34:15 CC: </b>Ed, this is Houston. Understand you want the command module weight now?</div>
<div><b>143:34:24 Mitchell: </b>Whatever you have; I'm out, ready to copy.</div>
<div><b>143:34:26 CC: </b>Okay. CSM is 34727 and the LM is 5103. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:34:44 Mitchell: </b>Understand. 5103, 34727.</div>
<div><b>143:34:49 CC: </b>That's correct, Ed.</div>
<div><b>143:35:04 CC: </b>And, Kitty Hawk; Houston. When you get through with what you're doing there, Stu, I do have SEP pad for you and a - an updated DAP load, but there's no rush on either one.</div>
<div><b>143:35:17 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll take the DAP load now. That's what I'm working on.</div>
<div><b>143:35:20 CC: </b>Roger. CSM is 34727.</div>
<div><b>143:35:36 Roosa: </b>Okay. 34727, thank you.</div>
<div><b>143:35:38 CC: </b>LM, 5103.</div>
<div><b>143:35:50 Roosa: </b>Okay, and 05103.</div>
<div><b>143:35:54 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>143:36:02 CC: </b>Antares , Houston. I have a LM LMPact P30 pad for you when you're free.</div>
<div><b>143:36:13 Mitchell: </b>Roger. Give me 5 seconds.</div>
<div><b>143:36:34 Roosa: </b>Well, I guess we'd better get to cracking, troops. I've got to put your 160 pounds of rocks some place.</div>
<div><b>143:36:40 Shepard: </b>Yes, Can't do it until we get the tunnel open.</div>
<div><b>143:36:44 Roosa: </b>Roger. I'll be working on that in just a second here. I'll start equalizing.</div>
<div><b>143:37:30 Roosa: </b>Okay, Antares. I'm going to be off the - off the air for about 3 minutes here.</div>
<div><b>143:37:40 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Stu.</div>
<div><b>143:37:56 Mitchell: </b>All right, Bruce, GO on your P30 pad.</div>
<div><b>143:38:01 CC: </b>Say again, Ed.</div>
<div><b>143:38:06 Mitchell: </b>I?m ready to copy P30 pad.</div>
<div><b>143:38:08 CC: </b>Okay. P30 purpose, good-bye LM. T. 147:54:18.90; NOUN 81, minus 0182.0, plus 0039.0, plus all balls; H and H are NA; DELTA-VD 0186.1; 1:15; 012, 176; A r K minus 0181.9, plus 0039-0, minus 0006.0. Read back. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:39:06 Mitchell: </b>I've got your LMPact P30 pad. 147:54:18.90; minus 0182.0, plus 0039-0, plus all zeros; H^, Hp, NA; 0186.1; 1:15; 012, 176; minus 0181.9, plus 0039.0, minus 0006.0. End of pad.</div>
<div><b>143:39:42 CC: </b>Roger. And you've already got the LM weight.</div>
<div><b>143:39:49 Mitchell: </b>That's firm.</div>
<div><b>143:39:52 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. If you would, we'd like a few words from you on the subject of the AGS. We've lost the AGS downlink telemetry and sort of at a loss as to what its current status is. Could you spare a little time for that?</div>
<div><b>143:40:11 . Mitchell: </b>Roger. It performed beautifully up until the time you asked me to check circuit breakers. I looked, and the circuit breakers are okay. I tried to look at it from a backup breaking gate about that time, and found I could not access it. Furthermore, the ball, the AGS ball, is still at 150 degrees pitch, zero yaw, zero roll and - has been for some time. And I had no warnings. All the circuit breakers were in, but I cannot access it to give a self test.</div>
<div><b>143:40:49 CC: </b>When was the last time you tried to access it, Ed?</div>
<div><b>143:40:57 CC: </b>Successfully?</div>
<div><b>143:40:59 Mitchell: </b>Well, just now at - oh - about - oh, shortly before we hit the breaking gate.</div>
<div><b>143:41:08 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>143:41:24 CC: </b>Ed, this is Houston. We'd like you to - on panel 16, cycle the ASA and AE circuit breaker -AEA circuit breaker, if you would, please?</div>
<div><b>143:41:45 Mitchell: </b>Okay. They're cycled. In further answer to that last question, Bruce. It was some - somewhere around AOS, but I don't remember exactly when.</div>
<div><b>143:41:55 CC: </b>Roger, Ed. That's close enough.</div>
<div><b>143:41:59 Mitchell: </b>Good enough. I abandoned the AGS and started setting up the cameras for the docking about that point.</div>
<div><b>143:42:05 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. And, if you didn't see any change, we'd like you to take the AGS operate switch - the AGS STATUS switch and cycle it from OPERATE to STANDBY and back to OPERATE, and if that doesn't do any good, on panel 11, we'd like to close the Commander's AEA circuit breaker. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:42:34 Mitchell: </b>Okay. That hasn't been any good. We'll try the other one.</div>
<div><b>143:42:41 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'm back now.</div>
<div><b>143:43:01 Mitchell: </b>That doesn't seem to help either, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>143:43:05 CC: </b>Okay. Which one was that?</div>
<div><b>143:43:11 Mitchell: </b>Any of them. I - I put in the Commander's circuit breaker and still has not gotten anywhere with it.</div>
<div><b>143:43:16 CC: </b>Okay. Let's skip the AGS and leave it in its present situation and I've got a few items I'd like to read off for return - over and above the nominal return items.</div>
<div><b>143:43:47 CC: </b>Ed, this is Houston. I'd like to read you up some extra return items, if you've got a piece of paper around.</div>
<div><b>143:43:58 Mitchell: </b>Okay, I'm ready to copy.</div>
<div><b>143:43:59 CC: </b>Okay, item number 1, the 100-foot tether. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:44:11 Mitchell: </b>Okay, we got that one.</div>
<div><b>143:44:13 CC: </b>Number 2, the LEC waste/tether combination. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:44:24 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>143:44:26 CC: </b>Number 3, 30-foot tiedown webbing. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:44:43 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>143:44:46 CC: </b>Item number 4 - -</div>
<div><b>143:44:47 Roosa: </b>Okay, I'm cracking the hatch now.</div>
<div><b>143:44:48 CC: </b>- - We would like to bring back the Commander's Hasselblad and recommend that that go in the ISA. If you want to bring back the LMP Hasselblad, also, that could go in B-l, but we need .he Commander's Hasselblad. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:45:06 Mitchell: </b>(Laughter) We thought about bringing them both back, but since you said not to, we left one on the surface. But you'll have the CDR's.</div>
<div><b>143:45:14 CC: </b>Roger, we copy. Item number 5, we want both of the LMP's EVA gloves. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:45:26 Mitchell: </b>Okay, they?re aboard.</div>
<div><b>143:45:30 CC: </b>And, of course, we're going to bring back the docking probe. Now, on stowage: the first three items, the tethers and the webbing, can go in the temporary stowage bags in the command module. The Hasselblad in the ISA, which is normal, and your gloves can go in the PGA bag, and the probe up underneath the right-hand couch in the temporary stowage location.</div>
<div><b>143:45:59 Mitchell: </b>Okay, we've already stowed most of this stuff, Bruce. The tether - the 100-foot tether is already in the ISA; the LEC waste tethers can go in the TSB and so can the 30-foot tiedown webbing. The Commander's Hasselblad we can put in the ISA; the EVA gloves are already in the ISA.</div>
<div><b>143:46:26 CC: </b>Okay, stand by, please.</div>
<div><b>143:47:25 CC: </b>Ed, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:47:31 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>143:47:33 CC: </b>We'd like to get the - the tethers, especially the 100-foot tether, out of the ISA, because you?re going to be bagging the ISA in a - a contamination bag, and we plan on using the 100-foot tether, the LEC waste tether, and the 30 feet of tiedown for securing the docking probe for reentry; so we'd like - if you can do it without LMPact, we'd like you to get that stuff out before you put the ISA in the contamination bag. All the other stowage is okay. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:48:05 Mitchell: </b>Okay, we'll see what we can do.</div>
<div><b>143:48:07 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>143:48:36 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Are you back on the line? Over.</div>
<div><b>143:48:42 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>143:48:43 CC: </b>Okay. I don't want to interrupt, but whenever you're free, I've got your SEP pad.</div>
<div><b>143:48:55 Roosa: </b>Okay, why don't I take it now? I'm waiting for a hatch check here.</div>
<div><b>143:49:01 CC: </b>Okay, let me know when you?re ready.</div>
<div><b>143:49:06 Roosa: </b>Well, let her rip.</div>
<div><b>143:49:08 CC: </b>Okay. CSM SEP, RCS, T t 146:30:00.0; NOUN 81, minus 0001.0; Y and Z are all zips; roll, 301, 355, 348; the rest of the pad is NA; remarks, LM-jettison time, 146:25:00; and the roll, pitch, and yaw for LM jettison are the same as for SEP. Over.</div>
<div><b>143:50:04 Roosa: </b>Okay. SEP pad, 146:30:00.00; DELTA-VY, minus 1.0, all zips, all zips; 301, 355, 348; jettison, 146:25:00.00; 301, 355, and 348.</div>
<div><b>143:50:32 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>143:50:44 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Bruce. I'm ready to copy any pads you have for me.</div>
<div><b>143:50:50 CC: </b>Ed, this is Houston. I believe we're up to date already on you.</div>
<div><b>143:50:59 Mitchell: </b>Okay. I misunderstood. I thought you had a call for me a minute ago.</div>
<div><b>143:51:36 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. We'd like to get P00 and ACCEPT, if that's convenient with you, and confirm all the ROTATIONAL HAND CONTROL POWER DIRECT switches, OFF, please.</div>
<div><b>143:51:55 Roosa: </b>Okay. You've got P00 and ACCEPT and DIRECT, OFF.</div>
<div><b>143:51:59 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>143:52:15 Mitchell: </b>Stu, are the pressures equal in the tunnel yet?</div>
<div><b>143:52:19 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative. I'm about to drop the hatch.</div>
<div><b>143:52:53 Roosa: </b>And, Ed, did you verify, or A1, the FORWARD DUMP VALVE to AUTO?</div>
<div><b>143:52:59 Mitchell: </b>That's verify, Stu.</div>
<div><b>143:53:00 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>143:53:11 Roosa: </b>How dusty was it down there?</div>
<div><b>143:53:15 Mitchell: </b>We don't have a lot of dust in here, but our suits are sure filthy.</div>
<div><b>143:53:19 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>143:56:39 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Computer is yours.</div>
<div><b>143:56:46 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>143:57:57 CC: </b>Kitty Hawk, Houston. Were you calling?</div>
<div><b>143:58:05 Roosa: </b>That's negative, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>143:58:07 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>144:01:47 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston; 12 minutes to LOS.</div>
<div><b>144:01:56 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>144:09:51 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>144:09:58 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>144:10:00 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. With 3 minutes and 45 seconds to LOS, both vehicles are GO on all systems. We'll see you on the other side. Over.</div>
<div><b>144:10:14 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>144:37:00 : </b>BEGIN LUNAR REV 33</div>
<div><b>145:01:44 CC: </b>Apollo 14. Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>145:02:16 CC: </b>Apollo 14. Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>145:02:34 CC: </b>Apollo 14. Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>145:05:51 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.</div>
<div><b>145:06:12 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14. Read you loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>145:06:16 CC: </b>Roger, 14. I'm reading you down in the mud, here; but I can understand what you're saying. How are you progressing on the closeout?</div>
<div><b>145:06:29 Roosa: </b>You're coming in 5 square here; so, if you've got anything to say, we might can pick it up. And we're pressing along nicely.</div>
<div><b>145:06:37 . CC: </b>Roger. For your information, although I don't want to make this a formal flight-plan update at this time, after TEI, there will be no lunar topo, that is, no Hycon-camera photos. Do plan on taking the - Hasselblad shots, and the visual assessment of targets 1 and 2. But right after your DAP load at 150 hours plus 32 minutes, you can plan on initiating PTC and then initiating sleep. Over.</div>
<div><b>145:07:14 Shepard: </b>I don't believe that will be a hard one to fill.</div>
<div><b>145:07:17 CC: </b>I didn't figure you'd fight us on it.</div>
<div><b>145:10:22 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>145:10:25 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>145:10:32 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Bruce. What are we going to do about this closeout of the LM? Just ignore the AGS, huh? And stay with the PGNS? And everything else the same?</div>
<div><b>145:10:41 CC: </b>Stand by, Ed.</div>
<div><b>145:11:35 CC: </b>Antares, Ed; this is Houston. On the configuration, you may just leave the AGS in its current configuration. No need to target it or even fool around with it. And we'll be talking to you as you progress through the closeout. This does not constitute a GO for closeout. Over.</div>
<div><b>145:12:01 Mitchell: </b>Roger; Roger. Understand.</div>
<div><b>145:13:53 CC: </b>Antares, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>145:14:01 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>145:14:03 CC: </b>Antares, this is Houston. We'd like you to go through the DAP-loading procedure at the top of page 15 in your LM Time Line Book. We don't show the 12021 loaded in the DAP. Over.</div>
<div><b>145:14:23 Mitchell: </b>That's affirm, Houston. I haven't - I deliberately held off on that one.</div>
<div><b>145:14:29 CC: </b>Roger. We're showing some RCS thruster firings that maybe aren't necessary.</div>
<div><b>145:14:39 Mitchell: </b>Okay, loading it now.</div>
<div><b>145:20:06 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>145:20:10 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>145:20:16 Mitchell: </b>Roger, Bruce. I'm at the - ready for IVT to the command module.</div>
<div><b>145:20:24 CC: </b>Okay. Stand by, and I'll try and get you a GO.</div>
<div><b>145:20:34 Mitchell: </b>Oh, Bruce. The thing we're short on is getting the comm up here the way you want it. I don't -you haven't given me any steerable angles to set on.</div>
<div><b>145:20:49 CC: </b>Okay, Ed; you can go ahead and configure the comm at this time. The nominal values in the flight plan. PITCH, minus 40; YAW, plus 49, are valid. Over.</div>
<div><b>145:21:05 Mitchell: </b>Okay, I'll use those.</div>
<div><b>145:21:59 Mitchell: </b>Houston, your steerable is beeped up, and on SLEW,</div>
<div><b>145:22:05 CC: </b>Roger, Ed; the comm looks good to us and now we need RBTs 5 and 6 on both NORMAL and BACKUP FEED, over.</div>
<div><b>145:22:18 Mitchell: </b>Okay. That's what I was waiting for. Here we go.</div>
<div><b>145:23:58 CC: </b>Antares, this is Houston. You're GO for final closeout; good bye. Over.</div>
<div><b>145:24:06 Mitchell: </b>Okay, so long; see you on the other side.</div>
<div><b>145:24:09 CC: </b>Roger; out.</div>
<div><b>145:28:51 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>145:28:54 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>145:29:01 Roosa: </b>Okay, I'm bringing on the LOGIC switches.</div>
<div><b>145:29:03 CC: </b>Roger; stand by for PYR0 ARM.</div>
<div><b>145:29:40 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. LOGIC is ON.</div>
<div><b>145:29:44 CC: </b>Roger, Stu; stand by.</div>
<div><b>145:30:07 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. You are GO for PYR0 ARM, over.</div>
<div><b>145:30:15 Roosa: </b>Okay, thank you.</div>
<div><b>145:38:25 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14. I still have GO for jettison on time, 146 plus 25?</div>
<div><b>145:38:30 CC: </b>Stand by, Stu.</div>
<div><b>145:38:50 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. You are GO for a LM jettison on time. The only thing we see is P47, when you get down to it in the time line just before JETT. Over.</div>
<div><b>145:39:05 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll get my pyros - armed In a ...</div>
<div><b>145:39:10 CC: </b>Say again about the pyros armed.</div>
<div><b>145:39:13 Roosa: </b>Oh, I was just saying I was only missing one thing. I said I got to get my pyros armed, too.</div>
<div><b>145:39:20 CC: </b>Roger. We gave you a GO for - -</div>
<div><b>145:39:21 Roosa: </b>I'm on the last two things on the checklist.</div>
<div><b>145:39:24 CC: </b>- - the pyro arm a while ago.</div>
<div><b>145:39:27 CC: </b>Roger. We don't mean to be backseat driving.</div>
<div><b>145:39:30 Roosa: </b>That's all right.</div>
<div><b>145:42:39 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>145:42:48 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>145:42:49 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>145:42:55 Mitchell: </b>Roger. Can you verify you can get into the computer; or have you verified it?</div>
<div><b>145:42:59 CC: </b>Roger. The computer in the LM? Over.</div>
<div><b>145:43:05 Mitchell: </b>That's affirm.</div>
<div><b>145:43:08 CC: </b>Roger, we have verified it.</div>
<div><b>145:43:12 Mitchell: </b>Roger. Thank you..</div>
<div><b>145:45:05 Roosa: </b>Hey, it worked that time.</div>
<div><b>145:45:11 CC: </b>Roger, 14.</div>
<div><b>145:45:16 Mitchell: </b>And we bid sayonara to Antares.</div>
<div><b>145:45:20 CC: </b>Roger, 14.</div>
<div><b>145:52:16 Roosa: </b>Okay, Houston, we're through with the LM SEP burn there, and we?re maneuvering to the P52 ATT.</div>
<div><b>145:52:26 CC: </b>Roger, we copy; through with the SEP burn and maneuvering.</div>
<div><b>146:04:54 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. We have approximately 10 minutes to LOS. After you arrive at your P52 attitude, we'll be ready to send you up a - a desired orientation uplink, and have you noticed any dust floating around?</div>
<div><b>146:05:21 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>146:05:23 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston. Do you read 14?</div>
<div><b>146:05:27 CC: </b>Roger, 14.</div>
<div><b>146:05:35 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Six minutes and 30 seconds to LOS. How do you read? Over.</div>
<div><b>146:05:46 Roosa: </b>You're completely unreadable, Houston. Everytime you talk, we drop the signal.</div>
<div><b>146:05:50 CC: </b>Roger. Stu, you're coming in pretty well now. We'd like to have you acquire us on the HIGH GAIN.</div>
<div><b>146:06:03 Roosa: </b>Houston, if you're asking for P00 and ACCEPT, you have it.</div>
<div><b>146:06:07 CC: </b>Thank you. We also need the HIGH GAIN.</div>
<div><b>146:06:26 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>146:06:36 Roosa: </b>Houston, everytime you transmit, our signal strength goes down, just right in synchronization with your words.</div>
<div><b>146:06:48 CC: </b>Roger, Out.</div>
<div><b>146:07:11 Roosa: </b>Houston, do you read 14?</div>
<div><b>146:07:27 Roosa: </b>Houston, if you're wanting P00 and ACCEPT, you have it.</div>
<div><b>146:08:00 Roosa: </b>Houston, how do you read 14?</div>
<div><b>146:11:39 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Uplink complete. It's your computer. At 147 plus 10 plus 00, we'd like you to maneuver to roll, 026; pitch, 091; yaw, 000, for communications. HIGH GAIN will be PITCH, minus 10; YAW, plus 183. I repeat roll, 026; pitch, 091; yaw, 000. HIGH GAIN: PITCH, minus 10; YAW, plus 183; and the time for that is 147 plus 10. The normal time for the LTC photo pad maneuver, LOS, Over.</div>
<div><b>146:12:29 Roosa: </b>Roger. Verify the roll, 026.</div>
<div><b>146:12:34 CC: </b>Verified.</div>
<div><b>146:35:00 : </b>BEGIN LUNAR REV 34</div>

<div><b>146:58:56 CC: </b>Roger. You're loud and clear, Stu.</div>
<div><b>146:59:03 Roosa: </b>Likewise, Gordon.</div>
<div><b>146:59:06 CC: </b>Okay. I've got some pads here, the TEI-34 and 35 pads.</div>
<div><b>146:59:16 Roosa: </b>Well, we're mighty interested in the first one, anyway.</div>
<div><b>146:59:20 CC: </b>Okay. Let me know when you're ready to write.</div>
<div><b>146:59:33 Roosa: </b>I have pen in hand, awaiting your message.</div>

<div><b>147:02:20 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. Readback correct. I'm ready the TEI-35.</div>
<div><b>147:02:31 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>147:03:33 CC: </b>TEI-35, SPS/G&N; the weight is 34720; minus 0.72, plus 0.08; 151:16:02.94; plus 3097.7, plus 1633.1, minus 0468.2; 178, 358, 359; ullage, four jets, ele - correction, four jets, 12 seconds. Go ahead.</div>

<div><b>147:05:07 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. The readback is correct. I have some more information for this upcoming photographs with the 500-millimeter of the 13 S-IVB LMPact crater. Over.</div>
<div><b>147:05:24 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>147:05:25 CC: </b>Okay. Give us P00 and ACCEPT. We'll give you a state vector and target load while we're getting this.</div>
<div><b>147:05:37 Roosa: </b>Do you have it?</div>
<div><b>147:05:39 CC: </b>Okay. Information on the photo pass. At 148:15, maneuver to roll, 026; pitch, 104; yaw, 000. We. suggest you use magazine Papa, the same 500-millimeter COAS procedures as before. T-start is 148:23:03. For locating visually the target, we suggest you use the zero-phase landmark map 7 and 8. To refresh your memory, the LMPact crater is on the northeastern rim of Lansberg B located on a line from Lansberg B to Lansberg. So, these procedures - We want you to pitch at T-start plus 1 minute and ignore the ORDEAL. Do not use the ORDEAL numbers be - This is because of a misaline-ment due to the TEI REFSMMAT. The pitch should work out to be a pure pilot pitch. Over.</div>
<div><b>147:07:31 Roosa: </b>Okay. At 148:15, maneuver to 026, 104, 000. Use magazine P, the same 500-millimeter procedures. T-START at 148:23:03. Northeast rim of Lansberg B. I know the general area. I don?t know how good an area this type of photography covers, though.</div>
<div><b>147:08:06 CC: </b>I can - I think the field of view is probably noticed on your orbital maps there, if you want to look it up. I - I think I looked the one time. The 500-millimeter should just about catch all of Lansberg B, and - -</div>
<div><b>147:08:26 Roosa: </b>Yes. I - I thought it - Of course, I sort of got the LMPression today, Gordon, that - that it might have been narrower than that, but that's fine. I - I know the general area to photo.</div>
<div><b>147:08:49 Roosa: </b>And I guess you want me to do that after 1 minute, pitch to 328, and quit, huh?</div>
<div><b>147:09:06 CC: </b>The answer to that is affirmative. I have an up - -</div>
<div><b>147:09:15 Roosa: </b>And as soon as we finish that, we do the VERB 49. As soon as we finish that, then, we go right into a VERB 49 maneuver to the pad burn attitude, right?</div>
<div><b>147:09:25 CC: </b>That's affirmative, Stu. I also have a map update for REV 35.</div>
<div><b>147:09:28 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>147:09:33 CC: </b>Okay. It's your computer, now. We're through with the uplink., And LOS time is 148:50:34; 180 time: 149:15:29; AOS with TEI: 149:26:49; AOS without TEI: 149:36:45. Over.</div>
<div><b>147:10:23 Roosa: </b>Okay. I think the only one there that - give me the - I don't need the 180; but I got with TEI; AOS will be 149:26:49; without, 149:36:45. And give me LOS, again.</div>
<div><b>147:10:38 CC: </b>Okay. LOS, 148:50:35. You copied the AOSs okay.</div>
<div><b>147:11:24 CC: </b>14, Houston. For your information, there's about 3 minutes to the - 2 minutes and 50 seconds to the LM ignition.</div>
<div><b>147:11:33 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>147:11:50 CC: </b>Stu, this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>147:11:55 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>147:11:59 CC: </b>Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>147:12:09 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. We took a look at your geometry when you're in this attitude prior to starting the COAS maneuver. It turns out that you're probably going to be able to see, through the optics, Antares hit the ground. If you wish and you have the time, one of the LM crew there could select P24, and we've got the numbers to set into NOUN 89. And we'll give you a - an LMPact time. You may be able to see it hit.</div>
<div><b>147:12:47 Roosa: </b>Okay. P24, NOUN 89. Ready to copy.</div>
<div><b>147:12:51 CC: </b>Okay. Right now, we may have an update on this with - after they track it, after the burn but right now, minus 03.527, minus 09.576, and a plus all balls. Over .</div>
<div><b>147:13:15 Roosa: </b>Yes, I copy minus 03.527, minus 09*579, plus all zips.</div>
<div><b>147:13:23 CC: </b>Okay. That second register, last digit is 6, minus 09.576.</div>
<div><b>147:13:36 Roosa: </b>Okay. Minus 09*576. And what's the time of LMPact ?</div>
<div><b>147:13:41 CC: </b>Okay. LMPact time will be 148:22:19* This is about a minute and 40 seconds prior to when you'll start pitching for the - the C0AS maneuver. Over.</div>
<div><b>147:14:07 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>147:14:10 CC: </b>If it's handy and you wanted to try to photograph it through the sextant, we'd suggest using C-EX at a 24 frames per second, l/60th-of-a-second shutter speed, and start it at 30 seconds prior to LMPact, and let it run through to 30 seconds after. Over.</div>
<div><b>147:14:37 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>147:14:39 CC: </b>And the LM is burning now.</div>
<div><b>147:14:45 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>147:20:50 Roosa: </b>Houst - Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>147:20:52 CC: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>147:20:57 Roosa: </b>Okay. Those other procedures called for 250 and f/11. Isn't it going to be a little darker over at Lansberg, Gordon? Do we want to change those settings?</div>
<div><b>147:21:12 CC: </b>Stand by, Stu.</div>
<div><b>147:22:09 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. We'd like you to use f/ll, l/250th, focus infinity. Over.</div>
<div><b>147:22:32 Roosa: </b>Okay. f/H, l/250th, and infinity.</div>
<div><b>147:22:36 CC: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>147:26:28 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>147:26:33 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>147:26:39 CC: </b>Okay. That NOUN 89 and the time of LMPacts for the - for Antares are good, after looking at it after its burn. And if you're going to - Are you going to be using the DAC on the sextant? If so, we'll call a start and stop time to you.</div>
<div><b>147:26:57 Roosa: </b>That ' s negat ive.,</div>
<div><b>147:27:01 CC: </b>Okay. And just one other thing. We want to be sure that we see P30 and P40 before your AOS. There shouldn't be any problem with them. Before your LOS.</div>
<div><b>147:27:21 Roosa: </b>Okay. We'll sure try.</div>
<div><b>147:30:10 Roosa: </b>We'll just let you look at them early, Gordon.</div>
<div><b>147:30:13 CC: </b>Roger. We're looking.</div>
<div><b>147:30:31 CC: </b>P40 looks good to us.</div>
<div><b>147:30:37 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>147:32:36 CC: </b>Stu, this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>147:32:41 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>147:32:43 CC: </b>We've got about 9 and a half minutes until LM LMPact. And at the risk of insulting your intelligence, we just wanted to remind you to - that, if you do reselect P30 between now and the - and the burn, be sure to reload the NOUN 81s.</div>
<div><b>147:33:05 Roosa: </b>Okay. We won't reselect P30.</div>
<div><b>147:33:06 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>147:37:43 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>147:37:51 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>147:37:52 CC: </b>We'd like to have the TAPE RECORDER switch FORWARD prior to starting your COAS maneuver.</div>
<div><b>147:38:03 Roosa: </b>Yes. We'll give you a FORWARD and HIGH BIT RATE.</div>
<div><b>147:38:06 CC: </b>Okay. Four minutes to LMPact, now.</div>
<div><b>147:39:14 CC: </b>LMPact in 3 minutes.</div>
<div><b>147:39:42 CC: </b>Stu, for your information, trunnion should be about 41 degrees at LMPact. So, it probably won't clear the limit until just before - just before LMPact.</div>
<div><b>147:40:44 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. I've got a change to the setting on the Hasselblad, a last minute change. Over.</div>
<div><b>147:40:55 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>147:40:56 CC: </b>Okay. They want it at f/8 and l/125th of a second, f/8 and l/125th. Over.</div>
<div><b>147:41:44 CC: </b>14, Houston. Thirty seconds to LMPact.</div>
<div><b>147:42:59 CC: </b>Stu, 1 minute to T-start on the 500-millimeter.</div>
<div><b>147:43:10 Roosa: </b>T-start now, I believe.</div>
<div><b>147:43:19 CC: </b>You're right. My mistake.</div>
<div><b>147:43:30 Shepard: </b>Houston, 14. ...</div>
<div><b>147:43:41 CC: </b>14, Houston. Say again, please.</div>
<div><b>147:43:50 Shepard: </b>We were unable to see the LM LMPact in the optics.</div>
<div><b>147:43:56 CC: </b>Roger, A1. Unable.</div>
<div><b>147:49:01 CC: </b>14, Houston. We'd like a frame count on the Hasselblad, for this last pass here. Over.</div>
<div><b>147:49:11 Roosa: </b>Okay, stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>147:49:28 Roosa: </b>Okay, we went from 131 to 169, Gordon.</div>

<div><b>148:47:45 Shepard: </b>Hello, Houston; Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>148:47:47 CC: </b>Roger, Al. You're loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>148:47:49 Shepard: </b>Reading you loud and clear, Houston. Okay, Gordo. We had a good burn. Good burn. We're on the way home. Burn time was 1 second long: 2 plus 29; residuals before trimming, plus 0.6, plus 0.8, minus 0.1; residuals after trimming, plus 0.2, plus 0.8, minus 0.1; DELTA-V^, minus 21.1; fuel, 25; oxygen, 24; unbalanced decreased 40. Very smooth burn.</div>
<div><b>148:48:24 CC: </b>Roger , Al. That's good news.</div>
<div><b>148:48:29 Shepard: </b>You bet. We're making like tourists with the cameras right now.</div>
<div><b>148:48:36 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>148:51:52 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. We have some flight-plan changes for you. The first of them, though, is not effective until about an hour from now; so, anytime anyone has some free time, I'll read them up.</div>
<div><b>148:52:11 Roosa: </b>Okay, Gordon. We'll catch them in a little bit, if you want. We're enjoying the view.</div>
<div><b>148:52:15 CC: </b>Roger, Stu.</div>
<div><b>149:03:39 Shepard: </b>Okay, Houston. 14 is standing by for the flight-plan update.</div>
<div><b>149:03:43 CC: </b>Okay, Al. Let's see, open the page to 150:30.</div>
<div><b>149:03:57 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>149:03:59 CC: </b>We'd like you to do everything as shown on up to the VERB 48 there at 150:35, or so. And then, we've got another procedure to - for one last-ditch try with the Hycon. The theory behind this is that in a static attitude with the FMC turned off, even though the shutter is malfunctioning, they think they can get an image on the film and then compensate for any exposure - off-nominal exposure to the film by development afterwards. The procedure is not too lengthy, but find some blank paper to write it on there.</div>
<div><b>149:04:59 Shepard: </b>Gordo, are you really serious about dragging up the Hycon, now? We?re just getting ready to go to sleep here, as soon as finish these handheld pictures.</div>
<div><b>149:05:09 CC: </b>Okay. If - -</div>
<div><b>149:05:11 Roosa: </b>Hey, Gordon, a little - Hey, Gordon.</div>
<div><b>149:05:14 CC: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>149:05:16 Roosa: </b>A little clarification on that. See, we hadn't planned on it. We've got it all stowed and everything all over it, since we hadn't planned on -on using it. It's pretty tough to get to, now.</div>
<div><b>149:05:28 CC: </b>Okay. I was instructed to mention it to you. If you had any feelings about it, well, just forget the whole thing; and that's what we'll do - just scrub it. So, after you change the DAP load there, we'd like you to do the procedures, as shown an hour later there at 151:30; go into PTC and presleep; and you're clear to hit the sack after that.</div>
<div><b>149:05:58 Shepard: </b>Okay. 151:30, PTC, presleep, and rest period.</div>
<div><b>149:06:03 CC: </b>Right. I don't mean to say you have to wait until 151:30 to do it. The procedures, as shown at that time, you can do those as soon as you're ready.</div>
<div><b>149:06:14 Shepard: </b>Oh, okay. Thanks. We'll probably do them a little sooner than that, then.</div>
<div><b>149:06:22 CC: </b>If you'll give us P00 and ACCEPT, we'll give you a PTC REFSMMATT,</div>
<div><b>149:06:35 Roosa: </b>Okay, you got it, Gordon: P00 and ACCEPT.</div>
<div><b>149:06:37 CC: </b>Okeydoke.</div>

<div><b>149:08:43 Roosa: </b>Okay; we got it.</div>
<div><b>149:09:25 Shepard: </b>Okay, Houston, on the last 52: NOUN 71* 24, 31; NOUN 05, all zeros; NOUN 93 is plus .018, minus .091, plus .050; GET torque, 146:58:25-</div>

<div><b>150:35:41 Roosa: </b>Well, don't know if you been trying to call or not. We've been hustling around on this storage, here.</div>
<div><b>150:35:49 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>150:35:51 Roosa: </b>And, do our rates look good enough for spinup?</div>
<div><b>150:36:02 CC: </b>Stand by 1, Stu. Stu, if you'll give us P00 and ACCEPT, we'll get a state vector before we spin up, there.</div>
<div><b>150:36:20 Roosa: </b>That sounds good.</div>
<div><b>150:36:24 CC: </b>Also, I guess we're going to have one for you to write down by hand.</div>
<div><b>150:36:33 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>150:36:35 CC: </b>I don't have it yet. For your information, we got a - we got a monster midcourse 5 coming up at TEI plus 17 of 1 foot per second.</div>
<div><b>150:36:56 Roosa: </b>Hey, that's good. TEI plus 17, huh?</div>
<div><b>150:37:00 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>150:37:03 Roosa: </b>You all sure do good work.</div>
<div><b>150:37:07 CC: </b>So do you guys. We thought you'd all gone to sleep on us up there.</div>
<div><b>150:37:14 Roosa: </b>Well, we were working on that, but we didn't have any place to sleep. We?re unindated [sic]. So, we've been scurrying around trying to get things in some sort of order.</div>
<div><b>150:37:26 CC: </b>Roger. Well, we want to power down your tired bodies, here, as soon as you can arrange it. We have nothing at all programed for about the next 12 hours. You guys have been doing an outstanding job here in the last couple of days, and we appreciate it.</div>
<div><b>150:37:44 Roosa: </b>Okay, Deke, I'll pass that on. I'm the only one on the loop right now.</div>
<div><b>150:37:48 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>150:38:49 CC: </b>Stu, it's your computer. I'll have that pad in a minute or two.</div>
<div><b>150:38:56 Roosa: </b>Okay. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>150:39:41 CC: </b>Stu, on the sleep, we won't wake you until - until an hour or so after the scheduled wake up time unless you're up sooner. Over.</div>
<div><b>150:39:57 Roosa: </b>All right. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>150:40:05 CC: </b>And I got the state vector for you.</div>
<div><b>150:40:10 CMF: </b>Okay, stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>150:40:27 Roosa: </b>Okay, Gordon, ready to copy.</div>
<div><b>150:40:29 CC: </b>Okay, it is a state vector 71. GET of 151:15:00; index 21, and address 2 is 01501, 00002, 03742; line five there is 11325, 76267, 44423; line 10, 77055, 42764, 13266, 10307, 70560; line 15 is 54223, 73757, 44252, 06426; line 21, 32440. Over.</div>
<div><b>150:43:32 Roosa: </b>Okay, reading state vector VERB 71; 151:15:00; index 21, 01501, 00002, 03742; 11325, 76267, 44423; 77055, 42764, 13266, 10307, 70560; 54223, 73757, 44252, 06426; 32440.</div>
<div><b>150:44:22 CC: </b>Roger; your readback's correct.</div>
<div><b>150:45:10 CC: </b>Stu, this is Houston. Computer is yours. The yaw jet's just about to fire; and so, we'll wait a little bit here, on the PTC spinup. Just want to be sure you have all your - your urine dump complete before - before you do it.</div>
<div><b>150:45:32 Roosa: </b>Okay. Yes, why don't you hold off on that for a little bit and we'll - We're not quite ready to spin it up.</div>
<div><b>150:45:41 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>150:47:17 CC: </b>Hey, Stu; this is Houston. Is your clean happy home still clean?' We haven't heard much comment about any microlunar samples floating around.</div>
<div><b>150:47:31 Roosa: </b>Yes. It's amazingly clean, Deke, Almost no dust at all. The suits were a little dirty but vacuumed off, and we got almost zero in the command module.</div>
<div><b>150:47:50 CC: </b>Outstanding.</div>
<div><b>151:13:26 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>151:13:31 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>151:13:33 CC: </b>Yes, Stu. You guys aren't worrying about stowing the probe at the present time, are you?</div>
<div><b>151:13:42 Roosa: </b>No. No, Deke. We're just getting a little chow and getting - getting squared away - sort of relaxing and looking at the full Moon coming -going away from us and so forth. No, we're in good shape.</div>
<div><b>151:13:55 CC: </b>Okay. Fine. Well, we got a nice exotic procedure to read up to you some time in the next couple of days on final stowage on that thing. And we didn't want you worrying about it.</div>
<div><b>151:14:06 Roosa: </b>No, we're - We put it in a resting place up in the tunnel. We figured that'd be pretty good until we got back.</div>
<div><b>151:14:14 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>151:14:17 Roosa: </b>And ready to reenter.</div>
<div><b>151:14:19 CC: </b>Roger.</div>

<div><b>151:39:08 Roosa: </b>Okay, Gordon. We're ready to spin up any time the rates look good to you, and I have some onboard read-outs.</div>
<div><b>151:39:18 CC: </b>Okay. Well, they're taking a check on it. They want to look at it a minute or 2, Go ahead with the read-outs.</div>
<div><b>151:39:27 Roosa: </b>Okay. Yes, they might have some rates, now; I just - maybe want to wait a little bit, but - Okay: BAT C, 37.0; pyro A, 37.2; pyro B, 37.2; RCS, 60, 58, 60, 6o.</div>
<div><b>151:39:49 CC: </b>Okay. We got all .that.</div>
<div><b>151:40:00 CC: </b>And, we'd like to remind you that - to be sure when we get the PTC going, to start - to go the -get the comm configured as shown in the checklist.</div>
<div><b>151:40:06 Roosa: </b>We'll do that. And far as crew status, we're all okay; no medication. And, you ready for an E-MOD dump?</div>
<div><b>151:40:18 CC: </b>Not yet; we're getting configured.</div>
<div><b>151:40:23 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>

<div><b>151:41:49 CC: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>151:41:53 Roosa: </b>Okay, Gordon. Just to make sure we're all together, you want to use the OMNI mode for comm?</div>
<div><b>151:44:00 CC: </b>Affirmative.</div>
<div><b>151:44:04 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>151:45:00 CC: </b>Stu, would you be sure that that WASTE MANAGEMENT OVERBOARD DRAIN is closed tight. We want to be sure that this one takes, so that we don't have to interrupt your sleep. And, if it is, then you're GO for spinup.</div>
<div><b>151:45:19 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>162:42:12 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Reveille, Reveille; heave out and trace up.</div>
<div><b>162:42:26 Mitchell: </b>Good morning, Bruce. How are you this morning?</div>
<div><b>162:42:28 CC: </b>Sweepers , man your brooms; clean sweepdown fore and aft.</div>
<div><b>162:42:35 Mitchell: </b>Yes, all the sweepers are still asleep around here.</div>
<div><b>162:42:40 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. How are you all this morning?</div>
<div><b>162:42:45 Mitchell: </b>Really great, Bruce; really great. How are things there?</div>
<div><b>162:42:49 CC: </b>Beautiful; everybody's relaxed down here and anticipating your arrival on schedule.</div>
<div><b>162:42:57 Mitchell: </b>Very good.</div>
<div><b>162:42:59 Roosa: </b>Good morning, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>162:43:02 CC: </b>Who's that? Stu?</div>
<div><b>162:43:05 Mitchell: </b>Yes, he's waking up over there.</div>
<div><b>162:43:06 Roosa: </b>Yes, man.</div>
<div><b>162:43:08 CC: </b>Hey, Ed, if you feel like configuring the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA for us, we'd like to set up in a REACQ mode but not select HIGH GAIN, yet. Over.</div>
<div><b>162:43:22 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>162:43:24 CC: </b>Okay, first off, we need the - -</div>
<div><b>162:43:26 Mitchell: </b>Jfy angles - -</div>
<div><b>162:43:29 CC: </b>Roger. We need a PITCH of minus 40 and a YAW of plus 90, that's PITCH, minus 40; YAW, plus 90, set in on the dials; WIDE BEAM, MANUAL TRACK -make it WIDE BEAM and REACQ, but do not select the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA until we call you.</div>
<div><b>162:43:53 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Houston. Out.</div>
<div><b>162:43:57 CC: </b>Roger. And I guess we needed to have the HIGH GAIN in MANUAL long enough for the antenna to go to those angles, then to REACQ.</div>
<div><b>162:44:13 Mitchell: </b>It's there.</div>
<div><b>162:44:14 CC: </b>Beautiful.</div>
<div><b>162:44:33 CC: </b>14, Houston. When you all feel like discussing things, we've got oh - about five or six items here, including a consumables update and a short update to the procedures on one of the inflight DEMOs, and some discussion on midcourses in general. Nothing very pressing; in fact, nothing pressing at all. We would like to get the P23 scheduled at 164 hours, started within about half an hour of the nominal time. Over.</div>
<div><b>162:45:15 Roosa: </b>Yes, Bruce. I'd like to go ahead and maybe start that one about now and then, P23, go ahead get going on it.</div>
<div><b>162:46:06 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this Is Houston. We'd like you to select the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA at this time. And, Stu, we see that you?ve got a P52 to run prior to getting to the P23. We suggest you go ahead and go through that and start the P23, more or less, at the nominal time.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>162:46:08 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Houston, Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>162:46:32 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>162:46:35 Mitchell: </b>Adjust HIGH GAIN.</div>
<div><b>162:50:28 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Did you call?</div>
<div><b>162:50:34 Mitchell: </b>Yes, that's affirm. I went to REACQs, Bruce. The antennas started driving around in a wild circle. I'm back on the OMNIs now.</div>
<div><b>162:50:45 CC: </b>Okay. We copy, Ed. Stand by.</div>
<div><b>162:52:04 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. We'd like to remain on OMNIs. You may stow the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA, MANUAL and WIDE, at PITCH, minus 52; YAW, 270. Over.</div>

<div><b>162:59:37 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. The consumables update for 162 hours follows: RCS total 48.8; quads in order, 48.9, 48.1, 49.6, 48.6; hydrogen, 45.7, 45.0; oxygen, 73.0, 70.2, 21.6. Over.</div>
<div><b>163:00:24 Shepard: </b>Houston - -</div>
<div><b>163:00:27 CC: </b>Say it again, 14.</div>
<div><b>163:00:34 Shepard: </b>Okay. A readback of 162 hours - -</div>
<div><b>163:00:49 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We're changing antennas. Standby, please.</div>
<div><b>163:06:26 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read now? Over.</div>
<div><b>163:06:32 Mitchell: </b>Loud and clear; go ahead.</div>
<div><b>163:06:34 CC: </b>Roger, Ed. I didn't get your readback on that consumables update. We switched OMNI antennas about that time. Were you happy with what you copied?</div>
<div><b>163:06:45 Mitchell: </b>That's affirm. Here, I'll read it back to you. The only ones in doubt is the 0^ tank 3 and, first decimal place. Okay, GET 162:00; RCS 48.8, order of 48.9, 48.1, 49.6, 48.6; H 45.7, 45.0; 0 73.0, 70.2, 21.</div>
<div><b>163:07:16 CC: </b>Roger. 21.6 on 0^ tank 3; and whenever it's convenient with you all, we would like to get that postsleep status report and acknowledgment on the postwakeup stuff on 162.</div>
<div><b>163:07:41 Mitchell: </b>Roger. I'll have it for you in a minute.</div>
<div><b>163:07:43 CC: </b>Roger. No rush.</div>
<div><b>163:08:25 CC: </b>14, Houston. We are copying your torquing angles</div>
<div><b>163:08:31 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce, and I'm torquing at 163:48:37.</div>
<div><b>163:08:44 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. And you can go on with the P23 whenever it suits your convenience.</div>
<div><b>163:08:52 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>163:11:26 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>163:11:28 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>163:11:33 Mitchell: </b>Okay, we verify that ...</div>
<div><b>163:11:37 CC: </b>You're cutting out, Ed.</div>
<div><b>163:11:42 Mitchell: </b>All of the items on the postsleep checklist have been completed. A1 had 7 hours sleep, Stu 6, Ed 7. And, unfortunately, the PRD is not available at the moment, and we will have to forget about the ...</div>
<div><b>163:11:58 CC: </b>Roger. We copy.</div>
<div><b>163:12:10 Mitchell: </b>Yes, and we've had no medication. We are al 1 in excellent ... So, just tell the surgeon to sit back in his chair and have a cup of coffee; we're fine.</div>
<div><b>163:12:22 CC: </b>Okay, I'll see if the recovery coffee or the procedures coffee - network coffee pot is working here, and we?ll get him a cup of coffee.</div>
<div><b>163:12:34 Mitchell: </b>Have one for me, too.</div>
<div><b>163:12:36 CC: </b>I just did, Ed.</div>
<div><b>163:15:45 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. On arrival in the optics-calibration attitude, we'd like to get the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA in WIDE BEAM width, MANUAL and with the flight-plan angles. Over.</div>
<div><b>163:16:00 Roosa: </b>Okay. We can handle that, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>163:16:04 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. And could you also verify that you're still on the SECONDARY, SERVO ELECTRONICS, POWER for the HIGH GAIN?</div>
<div><b>163:16:14 Roosa: </b>That's verified.</div>
<div><b>163:16:17 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>163:22:53 Mitchell: </b>Houston, switching to the HIGH GAIN.</div>
<div><b>163:23:07 CC: </b>Roger, 14; we?re receiving you loud and clear, now.</div>
<div><b>163:23:36 CC: </b>And, Ed; this is Houston. If you have got the flight plan handy, I've got a change to the heat flow and convection procedures, as called out in the back of the flight plan for you.</div>
<div><b>163:23:49 Mitchell: </b>Stand by, I don't have it handy, ... Houston, just a moment. But - -</div>
<div><b>163:23:54 CC: </b>Okay, well, let's get that later. Let him use it.</div>
<div><b>163:25:09 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Just for your information, RCS status shows about 131 feet per second DELTA-V remaining, and SPS is about 510 feet per second. Over.</div>
<div><b>163:25:31 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Bruce. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>163:25:36 CC: </b>And, looking ahead at the midcourse situation here, we'll have a decision for you shortly on whether we want to burn midcourse 5 or not. Right now, its magnitude looks like something on the order of a half to three-quarters of a foot per second. With no midcourses at all coming back, your gamma is minus 6.97 degrees. If we start making midcourses, 5 they say, would be about a half to three-quarters of 6's on the order of three-quarters of a foot per second, and 7 looks like about 2.7 or something on that order reading out. We'll keep you posted. We owe you some detail procedures on probe stowage, which will be up later on today. And, when Stu gets through with the P23, we'd like to clarify the status of his biomed harness. We didn't get any data from him up until about 160 hours this morning; and then, it came in loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>163:26:52 Mitchell: </b>Okay. I think we can clarify that for you.</div>
<div><b>163:26:54 Roosa: </b>I can verify the biomed harness is okay, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>163:26:58 CC: </b>Okay. Was it switched on all the time, or did you get up and switch it on about 160?</div>
<div><b>163:27:08 Roosa: </b>You've got it right.</div>
<div><b>163:27:15 CC: </b>Roger, Out.</div>
<div><b>163:27:49 CC: </b>And, 14; this is Houston. I've got some questions on the subject of the AGS again for ED, when he's free; and we've also got some news items if you're interested in hearing the news.</div>
<div><b>163:37:07 CC: </b>Apollo 14; this is Houston, Stu. Over.</div>
<div><b>163:37:15 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>163:37:16 CC: </b>Yes, Stu. If you could leave your NOUN 49 up there in the DSKY just a little bit longer, we could copy. We got the first one okay. We missed the last one here.</div>
<div><b>163:37:25 Roosa: </b>Okay. The first one was 21.2, and the second one was 1.9.</div>
<div><b>163:37:29 CC: </b>Okay, thank you.</div>
<div><b>163:37:39 Roosa: </b>And, Bruce? I want to verify that the state vector I'm working on now is the - is the TEI state vector. Is that affirmative?</div>
<div><b>163:37:57 CC: </b>That's affirmative, Stu. And we'd like to get MEDIUM BEAM WIDTH on the HIGH GAIN.</div>
<div><b>163:38:13 Mitchell: </b>Got it, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>163:38:16 CC: </b>Thank you, Ed.</div>
<div><b>163:39:33 CC: </b>Okay. We got that one, Stu. Just about 5 or 10 seconds is enough.</div>
<div><b>163:39:43 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>163:50:13 CC: </b>And, Stu, this is Houston. We're readying a checkpoint down here and, consequently, have no data for a minute or two. We'll call you when we're back in business; otherwise, we'd like you to keep the NOUN 49 for this next star, Antares, showing until we call you. Over.</div>
<div><b>163:50:36 Roosa: </b>Okay. I can just write them down for you.</div>
<div><b>163:50:56 CC: </b>Say, Stu, you'd better hold off on actually making the mark. We want to get the shaft and trunnion angles off of the displays also.</div>
<div><b>163:51:07 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll just stand by 1; no problem.</div>
<div><b>163:51:11 CC: </b>Okay. And we're back in business, Stu. You can press on.</div>
<div><b>163:51:16 Roosa: </b>Well, that was good timing.</div>
<div><b>163:53:02 CC: </b>Ed, this is Houston. If you have a minute, we'd like to get the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA pointing angles tweaked up for maximum signal strength. We're showing about a PITCH of minus 60 and a YAW of 0 as being appropriate. Over.</div>
<div><b>163:53:26 CC: </b>You got it, Stu?</div>
<div><b>163:56:29 CC: </b>Got it, Stu?</div>
<div><b>163:58:08 CC: </b>We got it, Stu.</div>
<div><b>164:05:37 CC: </b>We got it, Stu.</div>
<div><b>164:08:21 CC: </b>We've got it, Stu.-'</div>
<div><b>164:10:06 CC: </b>We've got that one also, Stu.</div>
<div><b>164:17:44 CC: </b>Okay, we got it.</div>
<div><b>164:19:48 CC: </b>Okay, we got it.</div>
<div><b>164:30:41 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. We copied the last NOUN 49 value there. And, for Stu's information, based on the sightings taken on the first three stars, we're showing that the program and the marks are all working out in excellent fashion within 1 sigma of the expected values. From the trench comes the information that your state vector compared with their estimate without any midcourse corrections, which show you arriving at entry interface 4 minutes earlier than the MSFN vector, at the present time. Over.</div>
<div><b>164:31:22 Roosa: </b>Okay, we'll see what - if we can work on that 4 minutes.</div>
<div><b>164:31:25 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>164:31:26 Roosa: </b>And we're going to be playing around here with the program a little bit.</div>
<div><b>164:31:30 CC: </b>Okay. And, when you're through with that and prior to starting your maneuver to the thermal attitude, we'd like to go through a normal acquisition procedure on the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA, hopefully winding up in AUTO and NARROW BEAM WIDTH to verify its tracking capabilities during the maneuver. Over.</div>
<div><b>164:31:54 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Bruce. Say again when you want to do this.</div>
<div><b>164:31:58 CC: </b>Roger. When Stu's through with his P23 and prior to starting the maneuver to thermal attitude that you've got called out - oh, at about 164:55, VERB 49, maneuver to thermal attitude. Over.</div>
<div><b>164:32:14 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Will do.</div>
<div><b>164:38:31 CC: </b>14, Houston. If you want to sit there in P00 and ACCEPT for a minute, we've got the target load and state vector update for you.</div>
<div><b>164:38:44 Roosa: </b>Okay. We're P00 and ACCEPT. I guess we're going to do midcourse 5, huh.</div>
<div><b>164:38:50 CC: </b>Roger. Sorry about that. Yes, we will burn midcourse 5 as scheduled. And I've got the midcourse 5 pad for you whenever you're ready to copy.</div>
<div><b>164:39:03 Roosa: </b>Okay. Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>164:39:52 Mitchell: </b>Houston, Apollo 14. Ready to copy it.</div>
<div><b>164:39:55 CC: </b>Roger, Ed. Midcourse correction number 5; RCS/G&N; 24561; pitch and yaw trim, N/A. T^ , 166:14:58.54; NOUN 81, plus 0000.7, minus all balls, minus all balls; roll, 092, 330, 009; HA is N/A, plus 0018.9; 0000.7, 0:03, 0000.7; sextant star 33, 256.3, 13.5; boresight star is N/A; minus 27.03, minus 172.62; 1158.8, 36251; 216:28:03; GDC aline, Sirius and Rigel; 230, 170, 002; plus-X, two jet, Bravo and Delta. HIGH GAIN angles in this attitude: PITCH, minus 90; YAW, plus 206. Read back over.</div>
<div><b>164:41:57 Mitchell: </b>Give again the jets to use, please, sir.</div>
<div><b>164:42:01 CC: </b>Jets Bravo and Delta, B and D. Over.</div>
<div><b>164:42:08 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Okay, midcourse 5; RCS/G&N; 24561; N/A, N/A; at 166:14:58.54; plus 0000.7, minus all zips, minus all zips; 092, 330, 009; N/A, plus 0018.9, 0000.7, 0:03, 0000.7; 33, 256.3, 13.5; N/A; minus 27-03, minus 172.62, 1158.8, 36251; 216:28:03; Sirius and Rigel; 230, 170, 002; plus-X, two jet, B and D. HIGH GAIN ANTENNA angles: PITCH, minus 90; YAW, 206.</div>
<div><b>164:43:34 CC: </b>Roger. Readback is correct. And were you aware that you're now coming back on Wednesday instead of Tuesday?</div>
<div><b>164:43:45 Shepard: </b>No, we haven't considered that fact. But I guess we'll make it up between the splashdown and Houston, right.</div>
<div><b>164:43:50 CC: </b>(Laughter) Roger, Roger you. After the TEI burn, it looks like you're about 3 or 4 miles west of the jog in the international dateline, as it comes down through your splashdown area.</div>
<div><b>164:44:10 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>164:44:34 CC: </b>14, Houston. The computer is yours. You can maneuver to the midcourse correction 5 attitude without going through the thermal attitude; that won't be required. And we would like to go through the normal REACQ procedure on the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA, prior to starting the maneuver, and see if it tracks. Over.</div>
<div><b>164:45:00 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Will do.</div>
<div><b>164:45:03 CC: </b>And, for Stu, we've got two minor corrections to the procedures for the heat-flow experiment, as found in the back of the flight plan.</div>
<div><b>164:45:16 Roosa: </b>I don't believe it. Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>164:45:45 Roosa: </b>Okay, I have the procedures out, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>164:45:47 CC: </b>Okay. On the heat-flow and convec - convection demonstration, under step 2 was zone low, power on. It currently reads 15 minutes. Turns out that all that's required here is 10 minutes. Over.</div>
<div><b>164:46:09 Roosa: </b>That's easy. Okay, under step 2, zone low, power on, 10 minutes.</div>
<div><b>164:46:15 CC: </b>Roger. And down there under step 4, zone high, power on, it's now 10 minutes, and you can reduce that to 5 minutes.</div>
<div><b>164:46:29 Roosa: </b>Okay, 5 minutes under step 4.</div>
<div><b>164:46:32 CC: </b>Roger. And there's no problem involved in these. It just appears that the color changes in the crystals will saturate at about this time, so rather than using up more power, we can just shut it off at that point. Over.</div>
<div><b>164:46:50 Mitchell: </b>Bruce, we lost you there for a minute. Let me read you right and understand exactly what you want me to do, ... go ahead and lock on and REACQ, and medium or ...</div>
<div><b>164:47:05 CC: </b>Negative, Ed. We want you to go through a normal manual acquisition procedure, winding up in AUTO and NARROW, over.</div>
<div><b>164:47:17 Mitchell: </b>Okay. But I'm already on the HIGH GAIN right now so I .. .</div>
<div><b>164:47:23 CC: </b>Okay. Then we're showing you minus 109 dB, so we must have lost you on the HIGH GAIN there, or you pointed off when you started the maneuver.</div>
<div><b>164:47:38 Mitchell: </b>* * ?</div>
<div><b>164:48:11 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. What we want you to do is to go to AUTO and WIDE BEAM WIDTH, and acquire us on the antenna; and then progressively narrow it down from WIDE to MEDIUM to NARROW. Over.</div>
<div><b>164:48:25 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Thank you. You have it.</div>
<div><b>164:48:34 CC: </b>Beautiful. I guess this is a semantics problem here, Ed. The INCOs have been using the terminology of standard acquisition to LMPly pointing the antenna towards the Earth manually, then going to AUTO and WIDE, getting it to lock up, and then on down into NARROW BEAM to complete the acquisition. Over.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>164:49:07 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Roger. That's what I understand as a normal acquisition, hut I - I thought I heard the word REACQ a couple of times, implying a position of the antenna, and I was confused on that one.</div>
<div><b>164:49:07 Mitchell: </b>Roger. That's what I understand as a normal acquisition, but I thought I heard the word REACQ a couple of times LMPlying a position of the antenna, and I was confused on that one.</div>
<div><b>164:49:20 CC: </b>Negative. That wasn't our intent.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>164:49:25 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Okay, Houston.</div>
<div><b>164:49:25 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Houston.</div>
<div><b>164:49:34 CC: </b>And, Stu, this is Houston. We'd like to remind you not to select P37 prior to the midcourse burn now that we've loaded the data for your burn from the ground. Over.</div>
<div><b>164:49:52 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>164:50:03 CC: </b>14, Houston. You reported to us earlier that the weight of the ISA as determined on the lunar surface prior to lift-off was 50 pounds. If, In your opinion, this weight has changed to greater than 55 pounds as a result of the LM return to CSM stowage, then we'll have to make provisions for tying it down. We'd like to get your feel for what the current weight on the ISA is. Over.</div>
<div><b>164:50:46 Mitchell: </b>Roger, Bruce. We*11 tell you it weighs exactly 54.9.</div>
<div><b>164:50:52 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. We copy 54.9 for the ISA.</div>
<div><b>164:51:47 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>164:51:49 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>164:51:53 Mitchell: </b>A clarification on the ISA, remember now, there are a few program things that are listed in the flight plan that went into it after it was weighed. Are you taking that into account?</div>
<div><b>164:52:08 CC: </b>Roger. We got the weight at 50 pounds from the lunar surface and can add in, if you like, down here those things. We were just interested in getting your feel for what had all been put in. And, if so, what the - what the weight increase would be.</div>
<div><b>164:52:30 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Bruce. This - The things that are in the flight plan to go into the ISA were added in as programed. And any additional items are almost negligible in weight and certain - certainly did not violate your 5-pound criterion.</div>
<div><b>164:52:47 CC: </b>Okay. Thank you, Ed.</div>
<div><b>164:53:08 CC: </b>And if you're interested, we've got the morning's news items here.</div>
<div><b>164:53:26 CC: </b>Or, alternatively, I've got some additional questions on the AOS for Ed.</div>
<div><b>164:53:35 Mitchell: </b>Let's take the news first, and then the questions.</div>
<div><b>164:53:38 CC: </b>Roger. Okay, 14. From Fra Mauro Base comes the word that ALSEP package number 4 continues to function normally during the reporting period, ending at 162 hours GET; the CPLEE heater was turned off; and a long period calibration of the PSE was performed. From West Fra Mauro comes the report that, when Antares augered in last night, the steerable antenna was still locked on, sending back high bit rate telemetry in fine tradition. "Anchorage, Alaska - -</div>
<div><b>164:54:27 Mitchell: </b>It had to do something to redeem itself.</div>
<div><b>164:54:32 CC: </b>- - "Anchorage, Alaska - An earthquake measuring between 6.5 and 6.7 on the Ritcher Scale occurred near Adak in the Aleution Islands Saturday, but no damage or injuries were reported. The seismograph-ic station in Berkeley, California, recorded the quake at 150 plus 14 GET, and scientists said it occurred close to the Earth's surface. The Alaska State Patrol said the trembler [sic] was centered south of Adak but was not severe enough to call for large wave warnings." "Stockholm - An Italian and a Norwegian-born Swede plan to repeat the 1909 North Polar Expedition of American Explorer, Admiral Robert E. Perry, right down to fur garments' and sleighs. Some of the Eskimo guides even claim to be descendents of Perry's original Eskimo crew." "Moberly, Missouri - -</div>
<div><b>164:55:33 Mitchell: </b>Lots of luck on that one.</div>
<div><b>164:55:35 CC: </b>- - "Moberly, Missouri - A radio station of Moberly has tried a number of times to place a telephone call to Alan Shepard on the Moon. One operator said, 'The Moon? Really? Do you have a number and area code?' Another took it in stride, said, 'All right.' The newsman asked how long it would take, and the operator replied she didn't know; and he was discouraged when, after asking if he could wait, the operator replied 'Okay.' Many operators laughed, but one ended the fun with a rejoiner 'Sir, there are no connections for civilians to the Moon at this time. We are sorry.'" "George C. Scott and Ali McGraw have been honored - -</div>
<div><b>164:56:17 Mitchell: </b>And that was the call A1 was waiting for, too,</div>
<div><b>164:56:25 CC: </b>- - "George C. Scott and Ali McGraw have been honored as best actor and actress in the Foreign Press Association's 28th Annual Golden Globe Presentations in Beverly Hills, California. Miss McGraw received her award for her part in 'Love Story.' Scott was selected for his part as General George Patton in 'Patton.'" "Houston - At the River Oaks Country Club, golf pro Jack Arden was quoted in this morning's paper as saying that, 'A1 has got a pretty good swing and could be a real good player if he worked at it.'" Along that line in the other golf news, Arnold Palmer, Tom Shore, and Dewitt Weaver are all tied for first place in The Haiwaian Open with scores of 204. That was after a third round yesterday, and a final round is to be played today.</div>
<div><b>164:57:24 Mitchell: </b>The only way A1 can keep his arm straight, though, is to wear the suit, and that gets cumbersome on the golf course.</div>
<div><b>164:57:32 CC: </b>Roger that. "The Houston Astros have passed the halfway point in signing on new players for the 1971 season. Signed contracts have come in from 23 of the 43 players who are scheduled to see spring training action. Regulars, such as pitchers Don Wilson and Tom Griffin, catcher John Edwards, and infielders Denis Menke and Bob Watson, and outfielder Norm Miller are already signed up. Also, the Astros have commitments from both their newest acquisitions from the Chicago Cubs, infielder Roger Metzger and catcher/first baseman Jack Hiatt." "New Mexico's Governor Bruce King and his predecessor David Cargo are in a dispute over who owns the Moon rocks presented to Cargo by President Nixon. Cargo took them when he left office December 31- King said he has asked the former Governor to return them back because, 'I think they belong to the State.'" "Charlotte Amalie (St. Thomas), Virgin Islands - the U.S. Virgin Islands is planning a permanent ocean-floor laboratory in Great Lamasher Bay, St. John, to provide a low-cost method of charting the untracked jungles of the world's oceans. The habitat, a large tubular twin-chamber cylinder, will be modeled after the one used in the recent Tektite Program and be financed by the Virgin Islands Government and private industry. The Navy says its first rescue minisub has shown it can locate a submarine trapped under water, lock onto it, and bring its crew to safety. The rescue vessel proved itself in test at a depth of more than 150 feet off San Clemente Island. The 50-foot sub located a metal structure representing a submarine, locked a transfer hatch over it, and brought a man through. They've dubbed the vessel 'the green torpedo.'" On the basketball scene, UCLA put the skids on USC in the big west coast basketball game last night. In a come-from-behind victory, the Bruins edged the Trojans 64 to 60. The Houston Cougars had a real battle with Seattle University at the Hofheinz Pavilion last night. They squeezed out a 93 to 92 win. In the Southwest Conference action, the Rice Owls dumped the Texas Tech Raiders by 80 to 64. Rice, smarting from a three-game losing streak, stopped the Raiders' three-game winning streak. Tech is number - Tech is 4-2 for the season; Rice, 3 and 3. In automobile racing, A. J. Foyt showed his driving prowess by winning the pole position for the big Daytona 500 on February 14. Foyt wowed the crowd as he turned in a qualifying lap time over the 2-and-one-half-mile oval with a clocking of 182.7-Defending stock car champion Bobby Isaac was second with a speed of 180.5 per hour. Foyt, who has never won the Daytona 500, is the favorite now with Isaac to win the 200,000 dollar auto classic. Former U.S. Davis Cupper Arthur Ashe defeated Clark Graebner of New York in the semifinals of the Fidelity invitational tennis tournament in Richmond, Virginia. And that about wraps up the morning news. Over.?</div>
<div><b>165:01:21 Shepard: </b>That's a very good rundown, Bruce. Very good. Why don't you let us hold off on the answer on the ISA for a minute? We'll run back over our checkout list and review those items while you're probably doing the same thing down there, and we'11 get back together with you a little bit later in the day on a good wave.</div>
<div><b>165:01:42 CC: </b>Roger. There's certainly no rush on it. We'd just like to know, at - prior to entry, so that we can determine whether it needs to be tied down or not, and if it affects the c.g. any.</div>
<div><b>165:01:54 Shepard: </b>Okay. We think the additional items are about 5 pounds; and let us go back over the checklist, and we'll give you a good answer later on.</div>
<div><b>165:02:00 CC: </b>Roger. And when Ed feels in the mood for it, I've got a couple more questions for the AGS.</div>
<div><b>165:02:09 Shepard: </b>Fire away.</div>
<div><b>165:02:27 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Bruce; I'm ready.</div>
<div><b>165:02:45 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. When the trouble first showed up, was there anything showing or was there anything left showing in the DEDA? And was it possible for you to clear this display, if there was anything showing? Over.</div>
<div><b>165:03:04 Mitchell: </b>That's negative. The first time I noticed that there was a problem was when you called my attention to it, that - I don't recall what - don't remember what the call was - but you asked about the - I guess the circuit breakers on the DEDA or on the AGS. That was the first time I ever realized that we had a problem. There was nothing showing on the DSKY. And, of course, I could not ENTER the DSKY or CLEAR it or anything else.</div>
<div><b>165:03:34 CC: </b>Okay. I guess that about sums it up.</div>
<div><b>165:03:40 Mitchell: </b>There is one comment. I noticed, just before leaving the LM, there appeared to be a very small crack across the address register on the DEDA. Now, how long it had been there, whether it was bumped after docking, or when it occurred, I have no idea. But there did appear to be a crack in the inner glass on the address register.</div>
<div><b>165:04:14 CC: </b>Okay. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>165:11:48 CC: </b>14, this is Houston, On your waste water dump scheduled for 166 hours, we'd like you to dump to 25 percent onboard indication. Over.</div>
<div><b>165:12:03 Mitchell: </b>Roger. Waste water dump to 25 percent onboard indication.</div>
<div><b>165:12:07 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>165:18:11 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. For systems recordkeeping purposes, if you have time, we'd like you to run an EMS null bias check, and give us the results on it.</div>
<div><b>165:18:26 Shepard: </b>Houston, I think we have that number. Stand by.</div>
<div><b>165:18:29 Mitchell: </b>Okay, minus 990 is the number.</div>
<div><b>165:18:32 CC: </b>Roger. We copy minus 990.</div>
<div><b>165:24:03 CC: </b>14, Houston. We'd like to get this waste-water dump out of the way before the midcourse burn. Over.</div>
<div><b>165:24:11 Shepard: </b>Roger. We'll start it right now.</div>
<div><b>165:29:07 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We show oxygen still flowing in the fuel cell purge.</div>
<div><b>165:29:21 LM?: </b>It's OFF.</div>
<div><b>165:34:06 CC: </b>14, this is Houston; 1 minute to the burn. We'd like you to terminate the water dump at this time, and go ahead and ENTER on your maneuver there.</div>
<div><b>165:34:15 Mitchell: </b>Okay, we'll be there.</div>
<div><b>165:34:54 CC: </b>Your slip T. is okay, 14. ig</div>
<div><b>165:35:00 Roosa: </b>We're going to just go ahead and burn it on time.</div>
<div><b>165:35:03 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>165:36:23 Roosa: </b>Okay, Houston; the burn is complete.</div>
<div><b>165:36:26 CC: </b>Houston. Roger, out.</div>
<div><b>165:39:27 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>165:39:31 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>165:39:35 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. I started this maneuver at optics CAL; I don't know if we'll have the HIGH GAIN there or not. Do you want to do the uplinking here? I kind of hate to stop the maneuver. Is OMNI Charlie going to be all right for you for the uplink?</div>
<div><b>165:39:52 CC: </b>That?s affirmative, Houston - 14.</div>
<div><b>165:39:56 Roosa: </b>Okay, thank you.</div>
<div><b>165:42:10 CC: </b>Apollo.</div>
<div><b>165:42:19 Shepard: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>165:42:24 CC: </b>All right, 14; this is Houston. Could you give us the reading on the DELTA-V counter on the EMS at the end of your burn, again, for systems tracking? Over.</div>
<div><b>165:42:51 Mitchell: </b>That was 0.3; plus 0.3.</div>
<div><b>165:42:53 CC: </b>Roger. Plus 0.3. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>165:49:06 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Request OMNI Charlie. Over.</div>
<div><b>165:52:56 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>165:52:57 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>165:53:00 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. Are you ready for the uplink?</div>
<div><b>165:53:02 CC: </b>That's affirmative. We're ready to send you up what will become the CM - the CSM state vector after we ship it over, and then there will be about a 2-minute delay while we get the MSFN-computed CSM state vector that goes in the LM slot out to the side. Over.</div>
<div><b>165:53:22 Roosa: </b>Okay. We?re P00 and ACCEPT, and standing by at your convenience.</div>
<div><b>165:53:26 CC: </b>Roger; out.</div>
<div><b>166:01:24 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We're through with the uplink. Computer's yours.</div>
<div><b>166:01:32 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>166:10:07 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:10:13 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>166:10:15 CC: </b>Say, Ed, We've got some modifications to the high-oxygen-flow tests procedures, here, if you'll advise us when you're ready to copy. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:10:29 Mitchell: </b>Roger. Stand by.</div>
<div><b>166:11:20 CC: </b>I understand you're ready to copy, Ed. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:11:29 Mitchell: </b>Stand by.</div>
<div><b>166:11:46 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Bruce. What page do you want worked on?</div>
<div><b>166:11:52 CC: </b>Okay. If you look on page 3-245 of the flight plan, the one that starts at 168 hours.</div>
<div><b>166:12:02 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>166:12:04 CC: </b>Okay. There are three steps there, that are: circuit breaker 0^ IS0LATI0N/AUX BAT, close, which is panel 226; 0^ TANK 3 ISOLATION valve, CLOSED, momentary; and 0^ TANK 3 ISOLATION valve talk back barber pole. We'd like to move those three steps up to 167 hours. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:12:43 Mitchell: </b>Okay. The three steps: circuit breaker 0^ ISOLATION/AUX BAT, closed; 02 TANK 3 IS0L valve, CLOSED, momentary; and 02 TANK 3 IS0L valve talk back barber pole. These are moved to 167 hours.</div>
<div><b>166:12:59 CC: </b>Roger. And, also, at 167 hours: circuit breaker OXYGEN TANK 3, 50-WATT HEATERS, open, 226. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:13:24 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Say it again, want you want done with that one.</div>
<div><b>166:13:28 CC: </b>Okay. Also, at 167 hours, we want to open the circuit breaker for OXYGEN TANK NUMBER 3, 50-WATT HEATERS. That?s CB 02 TANK 3, 50-WATT HEATERS, open, on Panel 226. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:13:57 Mitchell: </b>Okay. You want the TANK 3 - 0^ TANK 3, 50-WATT HEATERS, OPEN.</div>
<div><b>166:14:06 CC: </b>That's affirmative. You may commence the 0^ high - * flow tests at your convenience, following Stu's completion of the P23. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:14:19 Mitchell: </b>I understand.</div>
<div><b>166:14:21 CC: </b>Item number 3. The new heater redline temperature is 350 degrees Fahrenheit - that?s 350 degrees Fahrenheit, which corresponds to 3-6. I say again - 3.6 volts on the SYSTEMS TEST meter. Over</div>
<div><b>166:15:05 Mitchell: </b>Bruce, say again what the 350 degrees of redline is.</div>
<div><b>166:15:10 CC: </b>Roger, that's the redline on the heater temperature . Over.</div>
<div><b>166:15:16 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>166:15:18 CC: </b>And that corresponds to 3-6 volts on the SYSTEMS TEST meter.</div>
<div><b>166:15:27 Mitchell: </b>Thank you.</div>
<div><b>166:15:57 CC: </b>And, Ed; for tank 3, that's position 1 Charlie on the SYSTEMS TEST meter.</div>
<div><b>166:16:06 Mitchell: </b>Okay, thank you.</div>
<div><b>166:16:10 CC: </b>Okay. Some general comments, the test should be terminated if communications is lost with MSFN. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:16:24 Mitchell: </b>Understand. You mean - you mean other than just a dropout.</div>
<div><b>166:16:30 CC: </b>That's affirmative. If we lose communication for any extended period of time.</div>
<div><b>166:16:42 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>166:16:44 CC: </b>And, for your information, the minimum cabin pressure that we are expecting is in the vicinity of 4.4 to 4.2 psia. However, if the cabin pressure falls below 4.0 psia, you should terminate the test. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:17:09 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Understand you're expecting 4,2 to 4.4 cabin pressure; if it drops below 4.0, we're to terminate the test.</div>
<div><b>166:17:17 CC: </b>Roger. And if you're unable to terminate more rapidly than is required to keep the cabin pressure above 3.T, then bring the surge tank and the REPRESS back on line to maintain cabin pressure. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:17:34 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>166:17:50 CC: </b>Okay, Ed; and, on'the SYSTEMS TEST meter, make that position 1 Bravo, for monitoring tank 3, which is the one that you should be monitoring. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:18:04 Mitchell: </b>Okay; 1 Bravo, tank 3-</div>
<div><b>166:18:10 CC: </b>And, then, here?s a fairly long one. If tank 3 heater temperature, or tank 1, exceeds 350 degrees Fahrenheit, place the heater switch to OFF. I'll go all the way through this once, first. When the pressure drops to 800 psi, place heater switch to ON. Monitor tank pressure and heater temperature. Place heater switch to OFF when pressure reaches 930 or heater temp reaches 350, whichever occurs first. Test will be terminated if heater temp reaches 350 prior to tank pressure reaching 850 in this mode of operation. And - I'll go right back and start again from the beginning on that one in a minute. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:19:04 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Let's see if we can find a way to codify it so that it'll be a little easier to understand.</div>
<div><b>166:19:17 CC: </b>Okay, condition number 1. If the heater temperature exceeds 350 degrees, put the heater switch to OFF. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:19:35 Mitchell: </b>Okay. If the heater in tank 3 exceeds 350, heaters to OFF.</div>
<div><b>166:19:47 CC: </b>Okay. Under the assumption, then, that you're up in a normal operating pressure range when this happens, when the pressure drops - -</div>
<div><b>166:19:56 Mitchell: </b>Bruce, hold up a minute.</div>
<div><b>166:19:57 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>166:20:01 Mitchell: </b>Hold up a minute. Let's let Stu complete this P23, and then we'll get back on this. I'm interfering with him by working on the flight plan right now.</div>
<div><b>166:20:09 CC: </b>Okay; tell you what. Just carry out that stuff at 167 hours, and then, whenever you're ready to press on with this, give us a yell, and we'll go back through the rest of these notes. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:20:40 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>166:20:53 CC: </b>14, Ed; this is Houston. Since we?ve already given you the instructions to terminate the test if communications is lost, it might be more straight forward if we monitored the heater temps and pressures for you down here and advised you of the action required, if any off-nominal action is required . Over.</div>
<div><b>166:21:20 Mitchell: </b>Okay; that'll be fine.</div>
<div><b>166:21:22 CC: </b>Roger; then you've got - you got all of it up there now; and if for any reason you should have to terminate, why, the procedures are over there on page 3-248; they're the nominal termination procedures .</div>
<div><b>166:21:40 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Bruce; will do.</div>
<div><b>166:21:42 CC: </b>Roger, out.</div>
<div><b>166:31:47 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We'd like to initiate charging on battery Bravo. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:31:55 Mitchell: </b>Okay, stand by.</div>
<div><b>166:40:00 CC: </b>Come on, now.</div>
<div><b>166:40:05 Shepard: </b>All right; go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>166:40:09 CC: </b>I was just remarking at Stu's NOUN 49 value there, plus one-tenth zero.</div>
<div><b>166:40:19 Shepard: </b>Well, you're watching the world's leading expert on P23.</div>
<div><b>166:40:24 CC: </b>Well, I don't know. Jack Swigert wrote a paper on it.</div>
<div><b>166:40:30 Shepard: </b>We?re aware of that, also. Comment still stands.</div>
<div><b>166:40:37 Roosa: </b>Yes, that has nothing to do with Al's comment, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>166:40:42 CC: </b>Okay, I'll pass that along.</div>
<div><b>166:41:53 Shepard: </b>Bruce, you're also watching the world's leading expert on going from CMC AUTO to FREE and back.</div>
<div><b>166:42:01 CC: </b>Roger. We copy that, A1.</div>
<div><b>166:45:04 Shepard: </b>Houston, 14. We are applying power to the dump, AUTO heater, at 167:25, and we'll be doing the test in about 30 minutes.</div>
<div><b>166:45:16 CC: </b>Roger, Houston. Roger, out.</div>
<div><b>166:45:35 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We show that you're in HIGH GAIN ANTENNA coverage area at the present time. We'd like you to acquire on the HIGH GAIN; PITCH, minus 5; YAW, 250. Over.</div>
<div><b>166:45:51 Shepard: </b>Okay, we're shooting for that now. We're at PITCH, minus 5; YAW, 250.</div>
<div><b>166:45:59 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>166:46:19 Shepard: </b>Okay, you should have it now, Houston.</div>
<div><b>166:46:26 CC: </b>Roger, Al. We've got you loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>167:06:34 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>167:06:40 Shepard: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>167:06:41 CC: </b>Roger, Al. I just wanted to say, that I get a chance to say hello on the network. You guys did a great job yesterday, and I think things are in beautiful shape coasting home.</div>
<div><b>167:06:58 Shepard: </b>Well, thank you, Thomas. Appreciate those kind words. We're coming along well up here, too, right now.</div>
<div><b>167:07:05 CC: </b>Yes. Stu?s marks looking real good, and we had a great team effort on that landing; we'll tell you about it. In fact, I nearly lost all of my hair; would you believe that?</div>
<div><b>167:07:15 Shepard: </b>(Laughter) No, that would be pretty hard to believe, Tom.</div>
<div><b>167:07:22 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>167:07:26 Shepard: </b>Now, we're pressing ahead with the flight-plan items here, and we're staying busy.</div>
<div><b>167:07:30 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>167:08:10 Mitchell: </b>Houston, Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>167:08:13 CC: </b>Go ahead, Ed.</div>
<div><b>167:08:18 Mitchell: </b>Okay, back to our ISA weight problem.</div>
<div><b>167:08:28 CC: </b>I didn't know we had a problem, but go ahead.</div>
<div><b>167:08:32 Mitchell: </b>Okay, I was jumped on by both sources, here; it's not a problem; it was a question. The ISA contains the 50 pounds we measured on the surface, less the 100-foot tether, plus the 70-millimeter camera and magazine, plus a pair of EVA gloves, plus the return items on Deke's list.</div>
<div><b>167:09:12 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. We've got that, and we'11 work the arithmetic on the weights from down here and keep you advised. Over.</div>
<div><b>167:09:24 Mitchell: </b>Thank you, sir.</div>
<div><b>167:09:26 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>167:13:15 Roosa: </b>There you go, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>167:13:23 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. We copied that one for posterity.</div>
<div><b>167:19:32 Roosa: </b>You got the last one, Bruce?</div>
<div><b>167:19:40 CC: </b>Yes, we got that one, too, Stu; but you only get the first one framed and authenticated.</div>
<div><b>167:19:48 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>167:19:52 CC: </b>You still on Delta Sagittarii?</div>
<div><b>167:19:59 Roosa: </b>That's negative. That was the last mark on Antares.</div>
<div><b>167:20:02 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>167:28:36 Mitchell: </b>Houston, Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>167:28:39 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>167:28:42 Mitchell: </b>We're starting the 0^ test now. The heaters are going to AUTO. Opening up the flow valve.</div>
<div><b>167:28:52 Mitchell: </b>Delay that. We're standing by to open up the flow valve. It's not open yet.</div>
<div><b>167:28:57 CC: </b>Okay. Understand, heaters to AUTO; and you're standing by on the flow valve. Have you got the REPRESS package valve, OFF?</div>
<div><b>167:29:08 Shepard: </b>Yes. We're changing that now.</div>
<div><b>167:29:49 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Houston. The plug is up; we're flowing at 168:09:50.</div>
<div><b>167:29:54 CC: </b>Roger, 14.</div>
<div><b>167:30:07 Mitchell: </b>The screen has been installed on the adapter.</div>
<div><b>167:30:10 CC: </b>Roger, the screen.</div>
<div><b>167:35:27 CC: </b>Apollo 14. Stu, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>167:35:34 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>167:35:35 CC: </b>Okay. We continue to get praise of your ability on the P23s. Based on your navigation, your idea of your gamma angle at entry interface is minus 6.1 degrees. The MSFN solution corrected for the midcourse 5 burn, but without any postmidcourse tracking is 6.6 degrees. Over.</div>
<div><b>167:36:06 Roosa: </b>Okay. Yes, I noticed - I was comparing a VERB 83 there, Bruce; and I showed 625 miles, or thereabouts, prior to those last two sightings; and then, it was down to - I don't know 100 and some -after that. I think the sightings on the Moon is what really help bring it in. There were a couple of large updates there, I think, that really helped it.</div>
<div><b>167:36:36 CC: </b>Okay. That sounds like you're doing good work.</div>
<div><b>167:36:43 Roosa: </b>Thank you.</div>
<div><b>167:37:04 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. On telemetry, we're showing a cabin pressure of 4.7 right now and wonder what you've got?</div>
<div><b>167:37:19 Mitchell: </b>That's about 4.8, what we're showing, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>167:37:23 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>167:49:30 CC: </b>Okay, 14; Houston. Now, we're showing the surge tank at 750 on our telemetry, now.</div>
<div><b>167:49:39 Shepard: </b>As a matter of fact, we were just going to call you on that. We have a bias on our gage, that's good, we'll stay with - we're going to start the test at 168:30 - 168:29 - I'm sorry, 168:30:00, surge tank valve going OFF.</div>
<div><b>167:49:57 CC: </b>This is Houston. Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>168:22:34 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We'd like you to zero the optics, please.</div>
<div><b>168:22:46 Shepard: </b>Okay; stand by. Okay, you've got it.</div>
<div><b>168:23:01 CC: </b>Roger; thank you.</div>
<div><b>168:58:40 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>168:58:47 Shepard: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>168:58:49 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We're showing an 0^ manifold pressure of 8 pounds per square inch absolute, and we'd like to terminate the 0^ high-flow test at this time. Further procedures found in your flight plan opposite 171 hours 00 minutes GET, deleting the 10-minute step in there - deleting the 10-minute restriction in there. Over.</div>
<div><b>168:59:16 Shepard: </b>Okay. At 171 hours, we ... through termination procedures; got you.</div>
<div><b>168:59:22 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>169:04:03 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We shew the surge tank on line and the manifold pressure back up in the normal operating range, and we'd appreciate it if you'd advise us when you have the orifice closed off1. Over.</div>
<div><b>169:04:19 Mitchell: </b>Roger. It's closed off, now.</div>
<div><b>169:04:22 CC: </b>Roger. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>169:04:25 Mitchell: </b>Bruce, what was the reason for terminating the test? I didn't quite understand it.</div>
<div><b>169:04:31 CC: </b>Okay. The pressure in the 0^ manifold, which normally is regulated 85 to 110, got down to 9 psia; and the pressure in your water tanks was falling off from below its regulated range because of the pressure in the manifold. And we just thought it best to terminate the test at this time and reexamine the data that we've got on the plumbing leading down to it, and we'll be back to you with some info on it later. Over.</div>
<div><b>169:05:06 Mitchell: </b>Okay, we understand. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>169:06:41 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>169:06:44 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>169:06:49 Mitchell: </b>Do you want us to stay in this attitude, or shall we go on to the thermal attitude?</div>
<div><b>169:06:56 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Remain in the present attitude until 171 plus 30, and then maneuver to the thermal attitude. Over.</div>
<div><b>169:07:07 Mitchell: </b>Okay, and what about the isolating of the tank? Do you want to go ahead with those three steps , or do you want to hold off on those?</div>
<div><b>169:07:39 CC: </b>Stand by on that, Ed. We'll have the answer for you in a minute.</div>
<div><b>169:07:59 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Affirmative. Press on with the tank 3 isolation valve opening. Over.</div>
<div><b>169:08:08 Mitchell: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>169:31:37 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>169:31:42 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead. Houston.</div>
<div><b>169:31:44 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Back when you all were run- ? ning that P37 about an hour ago, we took your state vector and ran it through our computer here; and we got excellent agreement between the two solutions. We both showed a 0.9-foot per second midcourse, and the entry interface times were within 1 second of each other. The reduction here shows that the measurement plane error in the star sighting's themselves was less than 3-arc minutes. So, it's really looking beautiful.</div>
<div><b>169:32:20 Mitchell: </b>Three-arc minutes, huh?</div>
<div><b>169:32:22 CC: </b>Right.</div>
<div><b>169:32:23 Mitchell: </b>Well, that's very good, Bruce. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>169:32:26 CC: </b>And, with respect to the 0^ high-flow test, the feeling down here is that low pressure in the manifold was probably connected with some panel 251 activity, giving a higher flow rate. And if Stu's around, we'd like to discuss for a minute his plans on the demonstrations. Over.</div>
<div><b>169:32:49 Mitchell: </b>Okay. He's here. Just a minute; we'll put him on.</div>
<div><b>169:35:28 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>169:35:31 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. We wanted to just get a status report on the DEMOs, if you've'been doing any work on them on the way home, here, and see what your plans were for the TV show this evening.</div>
<div><b>169:35:48 Roosa: </b>Okay. Why don't you give us about an hour on that; I'm just in and out. We've been running some of the metal composites, but that - that's nothing to do with TV; all we're going to do there is just show the experiment and talk a little about it. And when you called, I was putting up the heat-flow experiment. We're going to take a look at that one and the liquid transfer and get a hand on it. So, I'll have some word In about an hour.</div>
<div><b>169:36:18 CC: </b>Okay. We're standing by for the TV at the regular time; and if you could tell us which ones of the metal casting that you've already run, why it might be of interest to people down here. We caught number 4 on the way out.</div>
<div><b>169:36:35 Roosa: </b>Yes. We've run 4, 5S 6; and 7 will be the next one.</div>
<div><b>169:36:35 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>169:39:36 Shepard: </b>Houston, Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>169:39:42 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.</div>
<div><b>169:39:48 Shepard: </b>Just to clarify a point. We're still planning on starting the TV show at 172:30. Is that correct?</div>
<div><b>169:39:54 CC: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>169:39:58 Shepard: </b>Okay. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>170:01:40 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>170:01:46 Shepard: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>170:01:48 CC: </b>Okay. We'd like to confirm that you did, in fact, turn the heaters and oxygen tank number 1 off for the continuation of our 0^ low-flow test here.</div>
<div><b>170:02:10 Shepard: </b>We're working on a 50-pound instrument error on that. I think we're reading about 865 right now. How do you look?</div>
<div><b>170:02:21 CC: </b>Okay. We're reading a little higher down here. Got about 889 showing on the TM.</div>
<div><b>170:02:30 Shepard: </b>Okay. That's fine. We'll turn it off now.</div>
<div><b>170:02:33 CC: </b>Okay; Roger. And for Ed, the folks in Kingston Court wanted me to say hi.</div>
<div><b>170:02:49 Shepard: </b>Understand you want Ed on the line.</div>
<div><b>170:02:51 CC: </b>No, just pass that on to him, and you might remind Stu to listen to his music.</div>
<div><b>170:03:00 Shepard: </b>Yes. We - we're listening to the music.</div>
<div><b>170:03:04 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>170:04:04 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14. This is Ed. Did you call me?</div>
<div><b>170:04:08 CC: </b>Ed, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.</div>
<div><b>170:04:13 Mitchell: </b>Roger. Did you call me?</div>
<div><b>170:04:15 CC: </b>I just wanted to say that the folks in Kingston Court said to say "Hello." They'll - -</div>
<div><b>170:04:21 Mitchell: </b>Thanks, Bruce. Appreciate that.</div>
<div><b>170:04:24 CC: </b>They'll be watching during the TV demonstration here.</div>
<div><b>170:04:30 Mitchell: </b>Very good. We're - getting the camera out right now, as a matter of fact.</div>
<div><b>170:04:36 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>170:32:47 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>170:32:53 Mitchell/Shepard: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>170:32:55 CC: </b>Ed, if you have a couple of minutes, we have a short test we'd like to run on the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA to answer the questions - some questions that the antenna people have and try to tie down a couple of questions that are still in their mind about it.</div>
<div><b>170:33:15 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>170:33:17 CC: </b>Okay. What we'd like you to do is set the dials to PITCH of plus 25 and YAW, plus 265, and then go to MANUAL and WIDE and then switch to the PRIMARY HIGH GAIN SERVO ELECTRONICS and try to make a normal reacquisition on the PRIMARY ELECTRONICS and hopefully, if it's working, we'll wind up - once you acquire backup in AUTO and NARROW. If you have any problems and it won't work properly, just go back to SECONDARY ELECTRONICS and back essentially in the mode you are in now. They want a - one final check on whether PRIMARY ELECTRONICS had indeed failed or not. Over.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>170:34:16 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>170:34:16 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>170:34:40 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>170:34:40 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>170:34:42 CC: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>170:34:46 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Okay. It seems to have popped right up very nicely this time.</div>
<div><b>170:34:46 Mitchell: </b>Okay. It seems to have popped right up very nicely this time.</div>
<div><b>170:34:51 CC: </b>That?s in PRIMARY, right?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>170:34:54 Mitchell (onboard): </b>That's affirm.</div>
<div><b>170:34:54 Mitchell: </b>That's firm.</div>
<div><b>170:34:56 CC: </b>Okay. We'd like to just stay in PRIMARY then, please.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>170:35:01 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>170:35:01 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>170:35:12 Shepard (onboard): </b>Ed, whre's a pair of scissors? Never mind.</div>
<div><b>170:35:18 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. That's really all they had to ask you to do. If you have any sort of failure in AUTO TRACK and PRIMARY, then go back to SECONDARY. Over.</div>
<div><b>170:35:36 Mitchell: </b>Wilco.</div>
<div><b>170:57:36 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>170:57:40 Shepard: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>170:57:41 CC: </b>Yes, how's your health up there today?</div>
<div><b>170:57:48 Shepard: </b>Oh, we're just fine, Deke. Everybody's in great shape. We had a little sleep last night. Everybody's a little bit tired after 2 full days, but we're fine now. And we're making preparations to run the TV show here. We're playing with the experiments a little bit ahead of time to get organized. And we're just going along fine.</div>
<div><b>170:58:08 CC: </b>Outstanding. You guys did a beautiful job and you sound great.</div>
<div><b>170:58:13 CC: </b>We've got one - -</div>
<div><b>170:58:14 Shepard: </b>Okay, thank you very much, Deke.</div>
<div><b>170:58:17 CC: </b>- - we've got one quick question here. Wanted to know how you feel at this point about doing that Q and A with the press tomorrow?</div>
<div><b>170:58:29 Shepard: </b>Sounds good to us. No problems at all with that.</div>
<div><b>170:58:32 CC: </b>Okay, real fine. Well we?re looking - -</div>
<div><b>170:58:34 Shepard: </b>I think we ought to work out a time - I think we ought to try to work out a time somewhere in the time line when it's convenient for everybody: the people on the ground and for us also.</div>
<div><b>170:58:45 CC: </b>Okay, well Flight thinks about 195:30 looks like a good time from all respects down here.</div>
<div><b>170:58:53 Shepard: </b>About 195=30?</div>
<div><b>170:58:55 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>170:58:56 Shepard: </b>Stand by.</div>
<div><b>170:59:45 Shepard: </b>Looks pretty good to us Deke. That's good spot in the time line from our point of view, also.</div>
<div><b>170:59:51 CC: </b>Okay, real fine. And they'd like to have TV with that. That gives us good coverage out of Goldstone for that.</div>
<div><b>171:00:00 Shepard: </b>Okay, we'll plan on that, then.</div>
<div><b>171:00:04 CC: </b>Okay, great, Al.</div>
<div><b>171:00:08 Shepard: </b>You sound pretty good yourself. How's your sleep level these days?</div>
<div><b>171:00:13 CC: </b>Well, I gained on you last night. I picked up about 12 hours.</div>
<div><b>171:00:19 Shepard: </b>Ho ho ho.</div>
<div><b>171:00:23 CC: </b>Talked to your bride today and saw her yesterday. Everybody's doing great familywise.</div>
<div><b>171:00:29 Shepard: </b>That's good. Thank you, sir.</div>
<div><b>171:00:31 CC: </b>You bet.</div>
<div><b>171:11:24 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>171:11:28 Shepard: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>171:11:30 CC: </b>We'd like to have you go to the thermal attitude as shown at 171:20 in the flight plan. Over.</div>
<div><b>171:11:41 Shepard: </b>Wilco.</div>
<div><b>171:29:54 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>171:29:59 CC: </b>Go ahead, Ed.</div>
<div><b>171:30:03 Mitchell: </b>The flight plan showing a NARROW DEAD BAND. Is a WIDE-band DEAD BAND good enough right now?</div>
<div><b>171:30:08 CC: </b>Stand by.</div>
<div><b>171:30:30 CC: </b>A WIDE DEAD BAND will be good.</div>
<div><b>171:30:35 Mitchell: </b>Roger, thank you.</div>
<div><b>171:30:36 Shepard: </b>Okay, Stu ... now.</div>
<div><b>171:38:35 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. We're ready for you to terminate the charge on battery B.</div>
<div><b>171:38:45 Roosa: </b>Okay, terminating B at this time.</div>
<div><b>171:38:48 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>171:51:09 Mitchell: </b>Houston; Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>171:51:11 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. We're getting a very nice picture of Apollo 14 patch. Over.</div>
<div><b>171:51:19 Mitchell: </b>Very good. How are you this afternoon, Gordon?</div>
<div><b>171:51:23 CC: </b>Fine. Gold Team's at your service and standing by for your show.</div>
<div><b>171:51:29 Mitchell: </b>Okay. We'd like to welcome you to an afternoon with Apollo 14 - a Sunday afternoon, by the way, with Apollo 14. And we're going to present some experiments for you. And our narrator for this afternoon will be Stu Roosa; and, I guess, he's about ready to go. Stu.</div>
<div><b>171:51:55 Roosa: </b>Okay, Houston. What we'll try to do this afternoon is show you four of the experiments that we're carrying on board; and even though we'd like to think that maybe they're a major breakthrough -Essentially what these are, are experiments to check out not only the theory involved in the zero-g environment but also the technical problems that we may face in designing bigger and better experiments for Skylab. And three of these experiments deal primarily with convection or, in our case, lack of convection, we hope, during the zero-g. And now, for the purists out - of you in the audience that say we should be calling it zero g, we'll concede to that and go ahead and call it zero g anyway, just for clarification; and everybody knows what we are talking about. But, really, what we're talking about is a free-fall situation, or the lack of weight. So, of course, on Earth under a one-g field, when you heat something, air, so forth, why, we say air rises; and this is due the influence of gravity on the - on the air that becomes less dense; and the cold air comes underneath; and you have your convection patterns, which everyone is familiar with. Well, under our situation, we probably have a lack of, or we do have a lack of these convection patterns; and we're going to use this to show some experiments and, hopefully, how in later missions that we can manufacture products and, perhaps, medicines and so forth. And the first one of these is the heat flow - it's a heat-flow experiment that we've got mounted over here, if Ed will put the camera on it. And what we have here are various cells; and, maybe, A1 can point them out there on the radial zone. And inside each one of these zones, as - as outlined here, is a heat-sensitive material. And it will change colors as it's heated. And they'll not all change at the same time due to the substance that the sensor is made out of; however, these two are exactly the same. And, now, under a g-field, if you had - had these two the same and you heated them, well, of course, the hot air would rise. And let's say that you had this sitting on the table, the one above it you would see a - a marked difference in the heating pattern. Here, under our weightless condition, the pattern should be the same. In other words, in these two cells, the heating should go out evenly on both sides. Now, you will see a difference on - on these two because of the sensor being of different material. So, if A1 will throw on the switch - and we'll see some response from this. It'll take about a minute. And, while we?re waiting for that, we have essentially the same thing in a different form, across the top. And we can only heat one at a time; so, we'll heat up this radial zone, first - I think you'll have a better chance of seeing this. And maybe, we'll throw - heat this up and throw it on -put the TV camera on them later. And while - while that's heating up, I'd like to show you another one that - that we've got. Okay.</div>
<div><b>171:56:05 Mitchell: </b>Houston. Color check on the picture - How's it coming through to you now?</div>
<div><b>171:56:11 CC: </b>We're getting a pretty good picture, Ed. But we're not noticing any difference in the crystals in the -circular heat-flow crystals, there - -</div>
<div><b>171:56:24 Mitchell: </b>They aren't going to show up on it, yet - so you wouldn't.</div>
<div><b>171:56:44 Roosa: </b>Over here, we've got a - another experiment. Well, let's take another one of the convection types. Let's take the metal castings there, Al, Okay, A1 has now got the - another experiment which we call metal composites. So, we have 18 different samples. These samples are metal. And really, what this experiment is, is to get some data -Okay. How's that picture, now, Gordon? Can you see the metal composite experiment?</div>
<div><b>171:57:05 CC: </b>Yes. Now, I have settled, and we're seeing it very well.</div>
<div><b>171:57:07 Roosa: </b>Okay. What we have are l8 of these small canisters, each one containing a different metal and/or a mixture. And the purpose of this experiment is to get some data on casting under our weightless or zero-g conditions. And here again, when you cast metals, you heat them; and when they cool, you have convection currents in them. Hopefully, here in our laboratory, we can heat these and cool them - They will have even cooling. And also, another part of this experiment is, some of the metals are mixed with fibers and/or various other particles. And the theory here, to increase the strength of the casting with these fibers. Now, on Earth, under a one-g field, this gets to be a rather difficult process because, during the cooling, the fibers settle out; and you don't get a homogeneous mix and a cooling; so, you don't have equal strength. So, what we do is, we heat these up and then we run through various processes. Some of them we shake; some of them we don't shake; and then, we cool them. We put them on a little heat sink, here. And we'll let it set and cool for a certain period of time; and then, we'll change it, put in another casting, and press ahead. There?s really not much else to show on - on TV with - with this one. It's - it takes quite a bit of time, by the time we run through all the castings; but we just park it up in the tunnel out of the way. And when our kitchen timer goes off, why, we'll either cool it or put in a new casting and press ahead. And I see the - getting some action on the convection experiment over here, on the radial experiment; and we'd be real curious, Gordon, if you can pick this up, if we've got enough light.</div>
<div><b>171:59:17 CC: </b>Yes, Stu. We can see a difference, particularly on the - as we're looking at it - upper left quadrant of the radial - window there.</div>
<div><b>171:59:36 Roosa: </b>Okay. Now, as I said before, this quadrangle will heat faster; so, you'll see more of - a faster color change. Now, these two will also heat, and these are the two that really show our zero-g condition, because these two will - and, - are heating out - extended the radial distance out - at the same rate. So, we're not getting any help, on either one of them, from the convection currents. And the fourth one is just now starting to pick up.</div>
<div><b>172:00:13 CC: </b>Roger - -</div>
<div><b>172:00:14 Roosa: </b>And we'll drop off from that one and just let it extend out a little bit; we'll talk about another experiment we have that also deals with convection.</div>
<div><b>172:00:27 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. The - That's very apparent that the upper-right and lower-left quadrants are heating equally. That's a very good picture.</div>
<div><b>172:00:37 Roosa: </b>Okay. And we - we did run this experiment on the ground before flight, and it was - It was very marked difference. It's quite LMPressive how it working - -</div>
<div><b>172:00:53 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>172:00:57 Shepard: </b>You do understand that the - this quadrant down here is a higher temperature crystal. That's the reason that - that it's not going out as fast as the one in the upper-left quadrant. It has nothing to do with the - the gravitational effect at all - it's a higher temperature crystal down here.</div>
<div><b>172:01:14 CC: </b>Roger, Al.</div>
<div><b>172:01:38 Roosa: </b>Okay. Now, Gordon, our intrepid LMP is - is holding another experiment. And how's that picture look? Can you get anything of Ed and the blue box here?</div>
<div><b>172:01:58 CC: </b>We're not getting it, yet. It looks like you're still getting the camera settled down, I'm seeing Ed's face - Now - now we're seeing it - That's right in the center, now. I think, maybe, if you stop the lens down, the - the little window is overexposed with respect to the rest of the scene; so, we've been getting not much more than just a bright light. That's looking real good, now. I think that's a good setting, right there.</div>
<div><b>172:02:30 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Gordon. And what we have here is an elect -electrophoresis experiment. And we're not - we're not going to run this one on the TV camera. It's a one-shot operation. But on the left side here, we're got three channels going across this beauty; and over on the left, in a chamber, we have three different compounds containing organic molecules. And what we're going to do is apply a voltage to each one of these chambers, and then, open up the partition between the chamber where the organic molecules are, and our channel going across. And the theory here being that as you charge the - the molecules, they will move out across this channel. Now, some molecules will take a better charge than the other ones, and they will move faster. Well, under a gravity field - here again, you have the convection currents; and it tends to mix up the molecules; the heavier molecules settle out to the bottom of the channel. They don't make it all the way across, and so forth. All the problems involved with the convection again. So here, hopefully, the only variable will be the different type of molecule. And we hope these molecules will then separate themselves in bunches - based on the assumption that all molecules of the same kind, you know - you know are all - been doing their physical conditioning and will run as the same rate. So, anyway, the molecules will move across and, hopefully, will separate them into bands. Now, we've got three different types of - of molecules here; and one, the sLMPlest one, it's just some red and blue dye. And this phenomena will take place under a gravity field, and this happens on the Earth. And we work up in numbers up to - to quite heavy molecules, and these are the ones that we cannot do on Earth. And we're trying to see if it's possible to - to do them here under zero-g; and there are quite a few ramifications to this, if it really comes off. And one of the most obvious is in the field of medicine, in making pure vaccines, and so forth. Now, we don't expect this - this experiment to solve the problems. We're trying to get a hack -see if the theory is correct and, also, to work out some of the engineering details, such as, when you heat - apply this voltage, you form a few gas bubbles around it, and so, we have to have a little pump that circulates the fluid at a very low rate. And we're wanting to see if this works and if it disrupts the travel of the molecules. So, this -this we hope is the first step toward bigger and better experiments and, eventually, a truly manufacturing process.</div>
<div><b>172:05:53 Shepard: </b>Ed, if you want to move on down closer to that light for a few minutes, we'll put you on the camera and, maybe, your family can see what you've got hanging all over your face.</div>
<div><b>172:06:04 Roosa: </b>We couldn't talk Ed into shaving this morning.</div>
<div><b>172:06:07 Mitchell: </b>Or yesterday morning, either.</div>
<div><b>172:06:12 CC: </b>You might open up the lens slightly, if you're going to a less brightly lit object.</div>
<div><b>172:06:22 Roosa: </b>Are you - are you trying to say Ed's not very bright, Gordon? (Laughter)</div>
<div><b>172:06:27 CC: </b>I guess I won't comment on the interpretation there.</div>
<div><b>172:06:33 Roosa: </b>Okay (Laughter).</div>
<div><b>172:06:34 Mitchell: </b>I'm being conspired against.</div>
<div><b>172:07:24 Mitchell: </b>Since I'm being conspired against, I'll take the camera back.</div>
<div><b>172:07:36 Roosa: </b>Okay. We'll come back down off the one that does not deal with - with the convection principle, and that's the transfer of liquid. If I can get out of the way here, and what - is that showing up, Gordon?</div>
<div><b>172:07:55 CC: </b>That's pretty good - -</div>
<div><b>172:07:56 Mitchell: </b>All you can see - -</div>
<div><b>172:07:57 CC: </b>- - for centering, Stu.</div>
<div><b>172:07:58 Mitchell: </b>- - is one great eyeball.</div>
<div><b>172:08:00 CC: </b>Can we --</div>
<div><b>172:08:02 Mitchell: </b>Okay. We're watching it.</div>
<div><b>172:08:04 CC: </b>That's looking pretty good. You might move the camera down slightly, now. It's in the lower part of the screen. Okay. It's centered; well - It was. Also, you might try a peak on the camera; it might LMProve the exposure. That was one suggestion from the background man there.</div>
<div><b>172:08:27 Roosa: </b>Okay,</div>
<div><b>172:08:34 Mitchell: </b>You have peak. How's it now? Peak and f/8.</div>
<div><b>172:08:40 CC: </b>I think that'll work. You might open it slightly, Ed. Open the f-stop slightly; and, I think, we'll have it.</div>
<div><b>172:09:00 Roosa: </b>Okay. What we've got, Gordon, is, of course, two tanks here; and these have no baffles whatsoever. And we tried to transfer the liquid from one, into the other one, and then back again; and we ended up in about the condition that - that you see here, not being able to do much with it. And I've got me a handy-dandy pump, which I'm going to mount on here. And this experiment is, of course, slanted toward the large space station refueling operations, transfer of fluids on a space station - Any time you have a rather large complex structure up here, why, you're going to have to be doing this type operation. And it's a first look at what type of baffles and - we need, and you'll see this on the other side. What I'd like to show you is a - the difficulty you have when you're trying to do them without any - without the aid of any baffles.</div>
<div><b>172:10:05 CC: </b>Stu, we see a couple of large bubbles in each tank. Will you point out just which part there is liquid and which part is the air space? Over.</div>
<div><b>172:10:17 Roosa: </b>Okay. The white portion you see is the bubble, and you should be able to see a green fluid around the bubble. Can you see the green?</div>
<div><b>172:10:28 CC: </b>That's affirmative. We can see where you're - what the parts that you're pointing out there. The colors on our monitor here are not coming in true, but that shouldn't hurt the point of the experiment. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>172:10:45 Roosa: </b>Okay. We'll now take - yes - okay. And we'll -Al's now working this pump, and - okay. We can't even get the bubbles - to change too much, here.</div>
<div><b>172:11:12 Roosa: </b>Okay, and about all we - okay if you'll watch that. About all you can succeed in doing when you pump with the pump is making the large bubble in the center, and the fluid has a tendency to cling around to the outside edge due to the surface tension. Now, this surface tension is quite LMPortant, and that is what will make the baffles work, as you see on the other side. But right now, the only surface for the fluid to cling to is right around the edge of the tank; and sure enough, that's where it goes, with the bubble in the center. And makes it very difficult, if not LMPossible, to work with.</div>
<div><b>172:11:51 CC: </b>Okay, that's very apparent from the picture we're seeing now.</div>
<div><b>172:11:58 Roosa: </b>Okay, okay. And a little bit of the hardware here, we have a valve up here at the top that connects -connects the two tanks through two - through a tube, here. Now, Ed, if you can get it down. And we've got a valve on each - on the top of each tank here, in which the pump will either pump into this tank or suck from that tank into this tank. The tubing here goes from these valves through a little hand-operated pump. So, that's the engineering behind it; and, of course, as you can see, the liquid just clings to the periphery of the - of the tank due to the surface tension. We'll now switch the tank and show you the operation, using the baffle.</div>
<div><b>172:12:51 Mitchell: </b>And while you're switching, I'll put the camera on Al; and let the world look at him. He did shave this morning. It didn't help a bit.</div>
<div><b>172:13:02 CC: </b>Roger. We can see that none of you look the worse for - worse for wear on the preceding 3 days' activities.</div>
<div><b>172:13:17 Shepard: </b>No, we feel great up here. Great shape.</div>
<div><b>172:14:02 CC: </b>Stu, a reminder; if you still have the heat on the radial experiment, you might turn it off. It - it might be overheating by this time.</div>
<div><b>172:14:11 Shepard: </b>Well, you might swing on over. There's another part of the experiment, that we're not sure you'll be able to see, that we turned on instead. I don't know whether Ed can get it on the camera or not, I'll push the top in.</div>
<div><b>172:14:32 Roosa: </b>Okay, now, up here, we have the ... we were heating - heating, extending out radially from a point here. Okay, up on the top, we're heating - Stand by 1; here, we'll get the camera rigged up. Okay, we've now switched to the zone cells, as they're called; and here again, we have the different crystals.</div>
<div><b>172:15:03 CC: </b>Ed, can you refocus there? As you moved in tight, we lost the focus and lost most of the detail of that part of the experiment.</div>
<div><b>172:15:21 Mitchell: </b>How's that, Gordon?</div>
<div><b>172:15:28 CC: </b>Okay, that's better. I think that range is good. Just hold everything as it is.</div>
<div><b>172:15:30 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Okay, Gordon. Now this is essentially the same principle only a different-type heating arrangement. Here, we're heating wiuh a band in the center, and we have the crystal in longitudinal strips running out from the center. And you prob -I don't know if you can pick up the color difference or not on these - on these bands as they move out.</div>
<div><b>172:15:55 CC: </b>We can see - -</div>
<div><b>172:15:56 Roosa: </b>I might add -</div>
<div><b>172:15:57 CC: </b>- - a little bit of difference there. It's not readily apparent; but, as you point it out, I believe we can see those zones moving out.</div>
<div><b>172:16:08 Roosa: </b>Okay, and that's it basically. Now when we actually do the experiment for data, we have a 16-millimeter camera that sits out 1 foot; and we turn in on, and it takes a picture, and you go through a sequence here. So it's - it's a detailed experiment, in which we have the procedures and we run through those. And just - what we're doing here is just showing you the gross features of the experiment and - and its typical operation. Not trying to show you exactly how we gather the data or anything like that. And we're turning off the heat-convection experiment, now.</div>
<div><b>172:16:51 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>172:16:56 Roosa: </b>Okay, how are we focused on the tanks now, Gordon? Stand by.</div>
<div><b>172:17:06 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. That looks really good. Just center it up slightly, and we can see the liquid and the baffles very clearly. Over.</div>
<div><b>172:17:18 Roosa: </b>Okay, just to point out that we've got two different-type baffles, I think you probably see the baffle, on this side, and over on this side there are two baffles running up, and with a little different feed-in arrangement - I meant bottom on the - on the baffle. Okay, now, I'll steady up the camera, and A1 will supply some power on the pumps, and you'll see the liquid now moving out. And due to the surface tension on the baffles, it clings to the baffles and comes out and fills up the tank in an orderly fashion instead of going up the side walls and leaving that large bubble right in the center.</div>
<div><b>172:18:14 CC: </b>That's a beautiful demonstration - -</div>
<div><b>172:18:15 Roosa: </b>I know ...</div>
<div><b>172:18:18 CC: </b>It's very clear from here.</div>
<div><b>172:18:20 Roosa: </b>Okay, good. Okay, we've got Just about all we're going to get out of the tank. Now, A1 will back it up, and we'll show you how the other set of baffles work. And you'll note the baffles not only aid on the fluid coming into the tank but also it makes for nice orderly discharge on the other tank. Now you can see it coming into this tank, with here again surface tension on the side walls and the two baffles, and proceeding to fill the tank.</div>
<div><b>172:19:18 CC: </b>That's very clear, Stu. You might run it back once more.</div>
<div><b>172:19:27 Roosa: </b>Okay, we'll give it to you again.</div>
<div><b>172:19:46 Roosa: </b>And I don't know if you can see it or not, Gordon; but when a bubble does come into the tank, it's broken up by the - by the baffles and tends to hang in pretty well. There, we just saw one burst there, if you happened- to notice that.</div>
<div><b>172:20:02 CC: </b>Hey, we can see that very clearly.</div>
<div><b>172:20:08 Mitchell: </b>Why don?t you run it fast and show the slosh, if you can get it that fast.</div>
<div><b>172:20:19 Roosa: </b>Okay, we're going to increase the rate of flow on this one.</div>
<div><b>172:20:22 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>172:20:37 Roosa: </b>Okay, now with the faster flow rate, you don't quite have time for the bubbles to dissipate, using the - using the baffles, and we did pick up a few more bubbles. And, Gordon, you really -you really - to appreciate this, you have to try the other side. I'm afraid that one didn't show up too well, because all we had were the two bubbles in the center;- but we can prove to you that the pump was working, because it works on this side. But it - it was just LMPossible to transfer any fluid after we opened the valve the first time, and got fluid out of one tank into the other one.</div>
<div><b>172:21:17 CC: </b>I think that's clear, Stu, now that we see how well this side works. We can see that the -without the baffles, it's a pretty hopeless situation.</div>
<div><b>172:21:27 Roosa: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>172:22:02 Roosa: </b>Okay, Gordon. That's probably about enough of liquid transfer. And I think we pretty well covered the - the four experiments unless you've got some questions, that I didn't make clear, or that has come up during the presentation.</div>
<div><b>172:22:26 CC: </b>One quick question. Did you have - Have you tried the - on the heat-flow convection experiment - the flow pattern part - part of it where you expected to see Benard cells, did that work out?</div>
<div><b>172:22:47 Roosa: </b>Yes. We tried that, Gordon, and it didn't work out too good. Maybe while we?ve got the TV here, we'll - we'll talk about that one and maybe you can give - get some help, and we'd like to try running it again. We ran everything except the Benard cells. And, Ed, could you put the camera back over on the convection experiment, Ed?</div>
<div><b>172:23:18 Mitchell: </b>...</div>
<div><b>172:23:19 Shepard: </b>What has been happening here, in this particular experiment, we have a Krytox fluid that's supposed to come out at three different locations along the base of this cup. Can you see that cup from -from there, Gordo?</div>
<div><b>172:23:30 CC: </b>Yes. We're getting a very good view of it.</div>
<div><b>172:23:40 Shepard: </b>This is the outline of the cup right here. It has three very small holes down at the base of the cup, at its periphery, and Krytox fluid flows in when we work a little hand pump here. And it's supposed to spread evenly over the bottom of this cup, which it does under one g. The cup is a heating element, and we - we're - we're - we were going to study the rate of growth of the - size of growth of Benard cells in the Krytox fluid. Unfortunately, we're not sure whether we have air in the fluid, too much air in the fluid, or not; but attempting to get the fluid to flow off the base of the cup through surface tension, we find that we don't have any luck, and rather it comes up along the walls of the cup adjacent to all three of the holes. And if you have any experts down there, we might just talk about that a minute.</div>
<div><b>172:24:46 CC: </b>Have you tried - -</div>
<div><b>172:24:47 Roosa: </b>Gordon, it ... - -</div>
<div><b>172:24:48 CC: </b>- - to use an object to move - to try force the fluid to spread on over the surface by opening the lid on it and then trying to force it to spread out evenly.</div>
<div><b>172:25:02 Roosa: </b>You mean physically spreading the Krytox around, Gordon?</div>
<div><b>172:25:08 CC: </b>That's - that's right. That's the question. We wondered if you tried that yet? '</div>
<div><b>172:25:13 Roosa: </b>No. We - we didn't. You know, our instructions there said if it didn't adhere to the - to the surface, we were to close up the lid and go home. We tried it three times; and to amplify there, it comes out of the hole, comes up the wall, and then spreads between the holes right on around the wall and just keeps packing up. We - we're most anxious to try it again; and we'll - we'll turn her on, and try spreading it across there.</div>
<div><b>172:25:45 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. We don't - -</div>
<div><b>172:25:48 Roosa: </b>It, it ... - -</div>
<div><b>172:25:49 CC: </b>- - intend to ask you to try all this on TV, but our only suggestion would be to maybe open it up and try to spread it across with your finger or with a tissue or something like that. But that seems to be the only idea to be offered.</div>
<div><b>172:26:07 Roosa: </b>Okay. Well, if you've got the time, we'll - we'll turn on the Krytox here and - watch - let you watch it come out.</div>
<div><b>172:26:15 CC: </b>Okay. We?re - be glad to watch.</div>
<div><b>172:26:35 Shepard: </b>What I'm doing here is opening a flow valve, between the tank and Krytox and the liquid plate. And over here we have a pump, which is actuated when I turn it in a clockwise direction.</div>
<div><b>172:27:02 Shepard: </b>Perhaps you can already see that we have fluid coming out, right here. It's staying right in this crevice, moving up the side walls. Can you see that on the camera?</div>
<div><b>172:27:14 CC: </b>Yes, sir. We can see that very clearly.</div>
<div><b>172:27:20 Shepard: </b>See, It's doing it almost the same all the way around it. This one is spreading a little further down the line, doesn't have quite as much fluid yet. But these two are spreading the same way. They're going up the walls as much as they are coming out on the floor. Now we'll get a finger in here and see what happens.</div>
<div><b>172:28:07 Shepard: </b>I believe we may be able to get enough there to show you the formation of these Benard cells.</div>
<div><b>172:28:13 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>172:28:46 Shepard: </b>We have a thin layer here, now, Let's turn on some heat and we'll see what happens.</div>
<div><b>172:28:50 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>172:29:23 CC: </b>Ed, a comment for the camera man there - we noticed a real LMProvement in the picture just about a minute or 2 ago. Which - If you did anything different there, remember what you did for future use.</div>
<div><b>172:29:24 Mitchell: </b>We just put it back on average from the peak we had it on a little while ago.</div>
<div><b>172:29:48 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>172:30:03 Roosa: </b>Yes. We should see some action here probably in a couple of minutes, Gordon, when these - when these form. I think you saw them down at the Cape; didn't you, Gordon?</div>
<div><b>172:30:13 CC: </b>No. I didn?t see those personally.</div>
<div><b>172:30:17 Roosa: </b>Okay. They're pretty LMPressive, and it breaks into the Benard cell here.</div>
<div><b>172:30:46 Shepard: </b>I think we're having the formation of some small cells; but, of course , the film we've put out here, so far, is fairly thin. It's difficult to get the vertical - vertical circular pattern set up.</div>
<div><b>172:30:59 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>172:32:17 CC: </b>Stu, the experts here would like to pass along the fact that it should take longer to get the cell formation with a thin layer of fluid than with a thick wet - than with a thick layer.</div>
<div><b>172:32:37 Shepard: </b>Yes; well, we have a peculiar pattern in this - in this fluid, which you probably can?t see; but the fluid, which I put in the center, stayed there, but there's a very thin layer here indicating that it's gone out radially again. And, as you can see, we have some pretty good-size fillets that stay right on the outside of the - of the cup. Very much the same principle as the surface tension that you saw in the experiment of the tank without the baffles.</div>
<div><b>172:33:09 CC: </b>Roger, Al.</div>
<div><b>172:33:22 Shepard: </b>Well, the cells are forming. You can see very small cells. But you probably can't pick them up with the camera, because the cells are only approximately a 16th of an inch in diameter, right now. I think - yes - if you hold on just a minute, we're going to see some pretty spectacular formations. They're starting to form right now and get a little bit larger.</div>
<div><b>172:33:47 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>172:33:52 Mitchell: </b>Gordon, are you able to see the detail of the cells?</div>
<div><b>172:33:58 CC: </b>Not really now, Ed. It's - we see some texture there in the - in the fluid, but it's hard to say that they're really cells from here.</div>
<div><b>172:34:12 Mitchell: </b>I think you'll be able to see them distinctly in a minute. They're starting to get larger and more active.</div>
<div><b>172:34:42 CC: </b>Okay, now I - Now we're seeing the cells pretty well. They're becoming much more apparent now.</div>
<div><b>172:34:54 Mitchell: </b>LMProved common techniques again.</div>
<div><b>172:35:29 CC: </b>Al, do you recall how many total turns you've put on the knob that pumps the Krytox out? They are curious just what total quantity is in the cup at this time.</div>
<div><b>172:35:42 Shepard: </b>Well, we have about two turns full right now.</div>
<div><b>172:35:46 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>172:36:26 Shepard: </b>Well, we do have some tiny cells here, and we'll play with this one some more and photograph it. In the meantime, you all might be thinking about that.</div>
<div><b>172:36:32 CC: </b>Roger, Al.</div>
<div><b>172:36:36 Shepard: </b>Well, we can definitely see these - the formation of the same type of cells, although they're smaller than we had down there. Perhaps with more fluid in there, we could get larger cells.</div>
<div><b>172:36:46 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>172:36:47 Roosa: </b>And, Gordon, after the TV here, we'll put the camera back up, and take a picture of what we've got here, just while it's there.</div>
<div><b>172:36:56 CC: </b>Roger, Stu.</div>
<div><b>172:37:08 Roosa: </b>Okay, I guess that's about all of it from our zero-g lab of Apollo 14. I think - we're real pleased with the experiments, and I want to compliment all of the Pi's and the work that they did. They - they came out extremely well; they went just as advertised on the procedures, gave us no trouble, and it's been - they've been real enjoyable to work with. And, hopefully, this is the beginning of bigger and better things in the way of manufacturing processes and so forth, in space. And I believe A1 has got some words here.</div>
<div><b>172:37:58 Shepard: </b>I just wanted to say a couple of words before we signed off tonight. What we've been talking about among the three of us, as we been setting up these experiments, is the contribution this could make, immediately and directly, into American lives and to the lives of people around the world. For example, if, specifically, these manufacturing processes of metals turned out to be better in the space environment; or the vaccines, which are proposed to be developed in weightless condition, can be used effectively and immediately. And, certainly, this type of an operation in Skylabs of the future can become immediately beneficial to the peoples of the United States and the peoples of the World. As a matter of fact, one of the things we're talking about, in that connection, was the tremendous achievements of the space program, so far, that have contributed particularly in the field of communication. For example, right now, I'm sure this broadcast is going directly overseas to millions of people who are seeing it in their homes through satellite. And I think many people have said that this LMProvement in communication through the space satellite will certainly go a long way in solving the problems of the World -problems of understanding between peoples of different nations and different countries. We are reminded, however, as we look at that shimmering crescent tonight, which is the Earth, on our way back, that there still is fighting going on. The three of us all have acquaintances, friends, and even relatives in Viet Nam. We are reminded that some of the people - some of the men who have gone to Viet Nam - have not returned, that are still being held there, listed as missing in action or as prisoners of war. And it is our wish, tonight, that we can, in some way, contribute, through our efforts to the space program, to promote a better understanding of peace throughout the World and help to rectify these situations which still exist. And with that thought, for Ed and Stu and myself, I will say good night to you from Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>172:40:21 CC: </b>Roger, Apollo 14. Thank you very much for the very interesting and - thank you very much for the whole show. We've enjoyed every minute. Good night.</div>
<div><b>172:40:41 CC: </b>Inspiring was the word that Gordon was looking for.</div>
<div><b>172:40:47 Shepard: </b>Okay, thank you.</div>
<div><b>172:49:01 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>172:49:06 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>172:49:08 CC: </b>The only suggestion we can make on that problem of the Benard cell flow pattern experiment there -is that that rubber surface around the edge of the cup is supposed to be treated so that the fluid won't adhere to it. Obviously, it's not working. The - the only suggestion that might work would be to take a tissue and wipe that off real well and try to clean it as well as possible; and then, try to put as thick a layer as possible of Krytox into the cup with your finger, if necessary, and the thicker the better, evidently, for results -more visible results. And a question for all the experiments. We'd like a status on just where you stand as far as taking data, if - on each of the four. If you could give that to us, the support people would like to know. Also, if you intend to work on it tomorrow, they'll be here to answer any questions, or whether you're going to finish it all up tonight. Over.</div>
<div><b>172:50:21 Shepard: </b>I - I don't think we'll be able to get It all completed by tonight, Gordo. However, if you give us a call when they're leaving, then we'll be able to tell you what the completion factor is.</div>
<div><b>172:50:46 CC: </b>Okay. Actually, they'll stand by as long as you wish. So, if you give us just a status right now, I think that's what they want. Have you taken any data on the - -</div>
<div><b>172:50:53 Shepard: </b>Okay, well, as far as - -</div>
<div><b>172:50:54 CC: </b>- - on the electrophoresis yet, for instance?</div>
<div><b>172:50:58 Shepard: </b>Well, let's start with the metal composites, as far as that's concerned. We have no problems with that, and, well, we have completed, I think, three or four of those, and we will press right on with those all the way in. As far as the heat flow is concerned, we have completed with the zone and the radial flows, and we'll try one more time on the Krytox. We, I think, only did the film of the fluid transfer. We have no questions on that; so, no further support on that will be required. And we have not made an attempt on the electrophoresis, yet. We're using that for demonstration, for television only. That's the only one that we would really need any support on at all.</div>
<div><b>172:52:48 CC: </b>Okay, fine. I think that answers their question.</div>
<div><b>172:52:50 Shepard: </b>We should be getting into the electrophoresis after we finish this next P23.</div>
<div><b>172:52:59 CC: </b>Okay, thank you, Al.</div>
<div><b>172:56:20 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>172:56:22 CC: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>172:56:26 Roosa: </b>Gordon, is anybody concerned about a little longer delay in going into PTC? I was looking ahead at these three constraint stars. We could cut those out if - I'm not suggesting it, but if we're concerned about the thermal aspect.</div>
<div><b>172:56:45 CC: </b>Stand by. We'll check on that.</div>
<div><b>172:57:10 CC: </b>Stu, I guess we - we don't see, immediately anyway, any - any particular rush to get into PTC. So, go ahead and complete the P23, as shown; and, if we come up with something, we'll call you later. That - that - something that requires us to get -get into the PTC sooner; I don't think there's going to be anything, though. Over.</div>
<div><b>172:57:32 Roosa: </b>Okay, I just wanted to check with you. We've been out awhile.</div>
<div><b>173:08:28 CC: </b>Apollo 14. Apollo 14, Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>173:08:35 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>173:08:37 CC: </b>Okay, tank 3 heater is getting up above the limit. It's 335 and climbing. We'd like to have you turn tank 3 OFF; 1 and 2 to AUTO. That?s the 0^ heater.</div>
<div><b>173:08:49 Mitchell: </b>Tank number 3 coming OFF; 1 and 2 to AUTO.</div>
<div><b>173:08:55 CC: </b>Thank you.</div>
<div><b>173:08:56 Mitchell: </b>You got it.</div>
<div><b>173:17:12 CC: </b>Stu, this is Houston. We think we - that you loaded 35 , Rasalhague, when you meant to load 33, Antares, there. Over.</div>
<div><b>173:17:31 Roosa: </b>Roger, Gordon. I copy that. Okay. You're so right. I'm seeing double here.</div>
<div><b>173:17:46 CC: </b>Big Brother is watching.</div>
<div><b>173:17:52 Roosa: </b>Good call.</div>
<div><b>173:54:40 CC: </b>Stu, this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>173:54:44 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>173:54:46 CC: </b>For Stu, we noticed - at least it looked like it to us here - that he took six marks on star number 5, rather than three on 5 and then three on 6. Probably have to do 6 over. Over.</div>
<div><b>173:55:05 Roosa: </b>Say that again, Gordon?</div>
<div><b>173:55:08 CC: </b>Well, the backroom guys that were watching said that you did six marks on number 5, rather than three on 5 and three on 6. Is that the way it seemed to you?</div>
<div><b>173:55:21 Roosa: </b>Okay, I'll do 6.</div>
<div><b>173:55:40 Shepard: </b>He knew 6 was going to be a difficult star, so he was practicing extra on 5-</div>
<div><b>173:55:46 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>173:55:47 Roosa: </b>Hey, Gordon. The tough one is that number 3. I don't know - I don't know why - that's a tough star</div>
<div><b>173:55:56 CC: </b>Yes , we get it.</div>
<div><b>173:56:40 CC: </b>A1, this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>173:56:45 Shepard: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>173:56:47 CC: </b>For EEC0M, we noticed one - on the last heater cycle on 0^ tank 3, that the temperature went up pretty fast. We'd just like to verify that the 50-WATT HEATER breaker is out. That's on panel 226. The - that's on tank 3.</div>
<div><b>173:57:09 Shepard: </b>Stand by.</div>
<div><b>173:57:14 Shepard: </b>You want - 0^ tank 3.</div>
<div><b>173:57:17 CC: </b>Roger. We'd like to know where it was when you look at it. We think it was out; we'd like to verify that, and we'd like you to leave it out, if it is out.</div>
<div><b>173:57:41 Shepard: </b>The breaker was in. It's now out. We're taking a look at our flight plan to see where that was supposed to happen.</div>
<div><b>174:42:12 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>174:42:16 Shepard: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>174:42:17 CC: </b>A1, we have a fairly lengthy procedure for stowing the probe for entry. We thought it might be a good idea to try to summarize it quickly to you now so that you can think about it somewhat. We're picking out a time tomorrow to accomplish this. We think that it should be no problem to finish it in about an hour, and it looks like maybe the crew exercise period scheduled at 190 hours might be a good time. So what we'd like to do is get Stu on the horn and summarize the whole procedure. Just quickly so you can think about it, and then when it comes - when you get ready to do it, rather than - probably it would be a long time -take as long to write down all these directions as it would to do' the stowage, so we could just, real-time, read the steps to you one at a time as you accomplish it. And it might be easier than trying to copy it all down. Over.</div>
<div><b>174:43:30 Shepard: </b>Okay, it sounds fine. As a matter of fact, we were discussing that a few minutes ago. If you'll hold on just a second, we'll put Stu on the air.</div>
<div><b>174:43:39 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>174:52:00 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>174:52:04 CC: </b>Roger; this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>174:52:07 Roosa: </b>Roger; I think we're all on the air.</div>
<div><b>174:52:09 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. I'm not intending for you to either write this all down, or to under - to remember it all. We'd just like to give it to you once through quickly so you can think about it, and we'll do it In detail tomorrow when we get around to doing it for real. The first thing is the stowage for the decontamination bags that ordinarily go on A-10 and A-13. We're going to modify that to stow the one that has 30 pounds in it, and put that one on A-13, using the existing tiedown rings. But the one that has 20 pounds, rather than putting it on A-10, we want to put it on A-8. And use the D-rings on A-8 in essentially the same manner - the normal manner of strapping it down. On top of that one, we want to take the CMP suit and helmet and put it in a sleeping bag, and then use the LM webbing and lash it down on top of the 20-pound decontamination bag on A-8. And this should all tie down there to allow a minimum 4-inch clearance to the couch for couch stroking. Are you with me so far?</div>
<div><b>174:53:48 Roosa: </b>Yes, that's fine.</div>
<div><b>174:53:50 CC: </b>Okay. Now for the probe stowage. We start by going through A-10. And remove anything you think you might need later. We can't identify anything in there that will be needed later, but you want to take a check, because once we get the probe lashed down on top of that - it will be pretty tough to get back in there. Then go to A-5 and remove the headrest pads and put them on the couches. Take the heel clips and ropes, there should be five ropes in there , and stow them temporarily. From the right-hand side of A-5, take the cushion and all the equipment that's in that cushion and put it in foodbox B-l. And from A-6, take the two LiOH cans from A-6 and put them in the left-hand side of A-5. So take the TV equipment that's in A-6, wrap the TV monitor in a constant wear garment, and put all the TV equipment into B-l, also. Okay. Now take the ropes -take one of the ropes that you removed from A-5 and double it, and then tie it to footpad on A-6 -the footpad that's in the corner. It'd be the plus-Y, plus-Z footpad on A-6. And take three other ropes and tie one end of each of those three ropes - we won?t double those ropes - tie one end of each of those three to the same point, that being the other footpad near the wall on A-6. It'd be the plus-Y, minus-Z footpad. Okay. Now we go to the probe and take two flight data file books and tape them to the base end of the probe, the end with the capture latch release handle. The probe now will be placed with one of the pitch arms - those are the large arms that - that normally contact the face of the drogue - one of those pitch arms down toward the aft bulkhead between A-6 and A-10. The apex of the probe pointing in the minus-Y direction and the base end of the probe with the flight data file books taped on them to touching the right-hand equipment bay. Is that clear - more or less the position that it - it'll be stowed in? Over.</div>
<div><b>174:56:54 Roosa: </b>Yes, it's real clear, Gordon. You're doing a great job.</div>
<div><b>174:56:58 CC: </b>Okay. Then the - there'll be six points that the probe will be resting on. I won't go into all of those, but we'll identify those as we go. And determine where, with a pencil or something, mark where these points are, and then remove the probe from that location. And on three of those positions we'll have to shim them up. One of the -one of these contact points will be shimmed with a sleeping bag, on top of which we'll put one of the rendezvous window shades and, on top of that, a flight data file book. One of the other shim points - one of the other contact points will be shimmed with a flight data book, and the third point will probably take a couple of flight data books to fill up the gap. Once we get the shims in place, we'll put the probe back down and check that all six contact points are indeed making contact. And then we go through a fairly - well about five steps of rope tieing, I won't go into the details, but we've got it all figured out where each rope coming from the A-6 footpads goes to on the probe and then back down to various other places, essentially lashing the whole thing down between points on A-6 and A-10. And as a final step, using tools that we've got for you from the toolkit, tools that we have identified, we'll take apart one of the support arms, we'll remove the bolt that holds that support arm to the shock strut, and then tie the loose support arm to the probe with the last rope to keep it from flopping around. This takes that support arm out of the couch stroke envelope. And that'll do it. How's that, clear as mud?</div>
<div><b>174:59:12 Roosa: </b>No. That's - that's pretty clear, Gordon. When we got to that part about all the rope tieing, you know, I thought I sure am glad I'm flying with two sailors, you know. Shoot, they can handle that, no sweat.</div>
<div><b>174:59:25 Shepard: </b>That's what you call abundantly clear. It sounds like you've put a lot of effort in to that one.</div>
<div><b>174:59:29 Mitchell: </b>I was just wondering how many new hires it took to figure all that out in 2 days.</div>
<div><b>174:59:34 CC: </b>There has been a few manhours spent on it. What I intend to do is go over tomorrow and do it all myself in the mockup. And then I'll probably spell Bruce sometime - if we end up at that same time in the shift tomorrow that we suggested around 195 hours - I'll be back here spelling him anyway, and I can go through the gory details with you as you do it, if that sounds good to you.</div>
<div><b>175:00:04 Roosa: </b>That's - that's great, Gordon. We sure appreciate all the effort you're going to here, and it sounds like you've got it well in hand. That was pretty clear - real clear the first time through, and with you giving us the details, it shouldn't be any sweat. In fact, I bet we could hack it right now.</div>
<div><b>175:00:23 CC: </b>Okay. Very good.</div>
<div><b>175:00:41 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>175:00:45 Shepard: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>175:00:47 CC: </b>Would you verify that you did change the lithium hydroxide canisters called for at 174 hours?</div>
<div><b>175:00:56 Roosa: </b>Naturally.</div>
<div><b>175:00:57 Shepard: </b>Absolutely.</div>
<div><b>175:00:58 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>175:03:10 CC: </b>Apollo 14 , Houston,</div>
<div><b>175:03:14 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>175:03:16 CC: </b>If you're all finished with your overboard dumps up there, your rates look good for starting the spinup. And we would like you to configure the HIGH GAIN in the coast to sleep mode as shown in -the Systems Checklist. We'd like you to use option 1 under that, which is with the HIGH GAIN operation as shown there rather than OMNI operation. We want to watch the HIGH GAIN awhile; and then, before you go to sleep, we'll probably go back to OMNI. Over.</div>
<div><b>175:03:51 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Gordon. Fine. I'll bring it up that way.</div>
<div><b>175:03:56 Shepard: </b>Okay. We'll spin up with B-2/D-2.</div>
<div><b>175:04:00 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>176:05:22 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>176:05:32 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>176:05:34 CC: </b>We're ready for you to go to the sleep configuration on the comm, if - any time you are. We'd like you to secure the HIGH GAIN in PITCH, minus 52, and YAW, 270, and MANUAL on WIDE, and then the other switches as shown in the checklist. Over.</div>
<div><b>176:06:01 Mitchell: </b>Okeydoke. We'll do that. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>176:06:04 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>176:06:13 : </b>(Music - Tijuana Brass, 'The Work Song')</div>
<div><b>176:06:42 CC: </b>Sounds like you?re having a party up there.</div>
<div><b>176:06:51 Mitchell: </b>Say again, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>176:06:53 Roosa: </b>Yes, we got a little music going up here.</div>
<div><b>176:07:03 Mitchell: </b>That's the only ingredients we have for a party, though.</div>
<div><b>176:07:07 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>176:16:42 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. EEC0M has informed us that unless we get these onboard read-outs before you go to sleep, we?re going to have to return to Earth as soon as possible. Over.</div>
<div><b>176:17:04 Mitchell: </b>Well, if we thought it would help, we'd just be quiet.</div>
<div><b>176:20:46 Mitchell: </b>Houston, Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>176:20:59 Mitchell: </b>Houston, Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>176:21:00 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>176:21:06 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Gordon. The onboard read-out follows: BAT C, 37 volts; pyro BAT A, 37.3; PYR0 BAT B, 37-3; RCS A, 58; B, 55; C, 57; D, 60; and stand by for the rest of it.</div>
<div><b>176:22:09 Mitchell: </b>And, Houston, 14. We have no medication to report. The crew is doing fine.</div>
<div><b>176:22:16 GG: </b>Okay, Ed. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>176:31:33 GG: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>176:31:40 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>176:31:42 CC: </b>We're at a good angle now for a E-MOD dump, if you?d like to give it to us.</div>
<div><b>176:31:50 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>176:31:53 CC: </b>And that about completes all the things that we had to pass up before you go to sleep. We want to finish the rest of the presleep checklist and wish you a good night.</div>
<div><b>176:32:09 Mitchell: </b>Okay, here it comes. Good night to you.</div>
<div><b>176:32:28 Mitchell: </b>Did you get my last, Gordon?</div>
<div><b>176:32:30 CC: </b>Negative. Say again, Ed.</div>
<div><b>176:32:33 Mitchell: </b>Okay, the E-MOD dump's on the way, and good night to you.</div>
<div><b>176:32:41 CC: </b>You planning to raise the cabin pressure now, or wait awhile?</div>
<div><b>176:32:49 Mitchell: </b>Oh, we'll wait awhile; we're not quite ready to go to sleep yet.</div>
<div><b>176:32:54 CC: </b>Okay, Ed.</div>
<div><b>185:22:57 CC: </b>Hello, 14; Houston.</div>
<div><b>185:26:09 CC: </b>Good morning, Apollo 14; Houston.</div>
<div><b>185:26:32 Mitchell: </b>Houston, Apollo 14. Good morning, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>185:26:37 CC: </b>Good morning, Edgar. It's pretty chilly down here. How's it up there?</div>
<div><b>185:26:49 Mitchell: </b>Oh, very comfortable; 71 degrees in the cabin. What do you mean by chilly? Is it freezing?</div>
<div><b>185:26:57 CC: </b>Well, let's see; this little report I've got here says it's supposed to get down to around 28 degrees.</div>
<div><b>185:27:09 Mitchell: </b>Man, have you moved Houston to the North Pole already?</div>
<div><b>185:27:14 CC: </b>Yes. There's also a pretty good breeze blowing which doesn't help.</div>
<div><b>185:27:22 Mitchell: </b>Got the old chill factor down a little bit, huh?</div>
<div><b>185:27:25 CC: </b>Yes.</div>
<div><b>185:27:29 Mitchell: </b>Well, hold on a minute. Let's see if I can wake the rest of these guys up.</div>
<div><b>185:27:33 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>185:28:16 Mitchell: </b>Now there's some grumbling going over - on over here about getting up, Fred, but I think they'll be around in a minute.</div>
<div><b>185:28:22 CC: </b>Okay. I had suggested that maybe we let you keep your banker's hours, but Flight brought up the point that tomorrow morning you can't afford to sleep in late, so - if you're going to get the job done and get back in - so, we'11 try to get you back on the schedule today.</div>
<div><b>185:28:42 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Fair enough.</div>
<div><b>185:28:55 Mitchell: </b>And I'll get some of these chores done; I'll be back with you in a few minutes, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>185:29:00 CC: </b>Okay, Ed.</div>
<div><b>185:39:28 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>185:39:33 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>185:39:35 CC: </b>Ed, I wonder if we can get you to put 0^ tank 3 HEATER to AUTO; tanks 1 and 2 to OFF.</div>
<div><b>185:39:52 Mitchell: </b>Okay. 0^ tank 3 HEATER, AUTO; 1 and 2 to OFF.</div>
<div><b>185:39:57 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>185:40:28 CC: </b>And, 14; Houston. I've got a few items that there's no big rush on. When you get free, just give me a call.</div>
<div><b>185:40:40 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Fredo. I'm switching to HIGH GAIN as per flight plan unless you say otherwise.</div>
<div><b>185:40:48 CC: </b>Stand by. Okay, Ed. Why don't you hold off on that a little bit? One of the - these things that we're in no big hurry on is to play with the comm a little more on the - checking PRIMARY and SECONDARY, et cetera. But we'll do that in a little while.</div>
<div><b>185:41:11 Mitchell: </b>Okay. And shall I start battery charge A now?</div>
<div><b>185:41:20 CC: </b>Roger. You can commence battery charge A.</div>
<div><b>185:46:09 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>185:46:25 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>185:46:31 CC: </b>14, Houston. I wonder if you could verify, Ed, that the TANK 3 50-WATT HEATER breaker on 226 is open.</div>
<div><b>185:46:44 Mitchell: </b>Fredo - Fredo, you're breaking up. Wait until we get the antenna in a better position.</div>
<div><b>185:46:49 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>185:51:09 CC: </b>How do you read now, Ed?</div>
<div><b>185:51:16 Mitchell: </b>Loud and clear, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>185:51:19 CC: </b>Okay. Since we had that tank 3 back in the line, we just wanted to verify that the TANK 3 50-WATT HEATER breaker on 226 is still open.</div>
<div><b>185:51:41 Mitchell: </b>That's verified; it's still open.</div>
<div><b>185:51:43 CC: </b>Very good.</div>
<div><b>185:51:47 Mitchell: </b>It's still a mystery as to how it got closed yesterday.</div>
<div><b>185:51:53 CC: </b>You've just got nimble toes, maybe.</div>
<div><b>185:52:04 Mitchell: </b>I guess that's quite possible.</div>
<div><b>185:53:23 CC: </b>And we have the NOUN 93s.</div>
<div><b>185:57:40 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>185:57:44 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>185:57:48 Mitchell: </b>Fredo, let me give you our postsleep report.</div>
<div><b>185:57:53 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>185:57:56 Mitchell: </b>Okay, we each had 4 hours' sleep; PRD for A1 is 16059; PRO for Ed, 07057; and. Stu didn't have one; it's broken.</div>
<div><b>185:58:14 CC: </b>Okay. We copy.</div>
<div><b>186:19:30 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>186:19:33 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>186:19:37 Mitchell: </b>I've been giving you these confounded medical reports every day; how's your pulse this morning?</div>
<div><b>186:19:45 CC: </b>It's pretty slow about right now, Ed.</div>
<div><b>186:19:50 Mitchell: </b>Okay. But you're alive and well and no medication, huh?</div>
<div><b>186:19:56 CC: </b>Yes. I'm on a different flight plan than you are. I'm just fixing to get to my sleep period.</div>
<div><b>186:20:04 Mitchell: </b>I see. Okay.</div>
<div><b>186:34:56 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>186:35:01 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>186:35:03 CC: </b>Okay. I wonder if you could set your two HIGH GAIN knobs to PITCH, minus 40; and YAW, 90.</div>
<div><b>186:35:22 Mitchell: </b>Minus 40 and 90. You have it.</div>
<div><b>186:35:24 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>186:35:44 CC: </b>And, Ed, I wonder if we can get - get you to put the switch to NARROW and REACQ.</div>
<div><b>186:35:59 Mitchell: </b>NARROW and REACQ. You have it.</div>
<div><b>186:36:02 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>186:36:21 CC: </b>Okay. And Ed, we?ll - we're just going to sit here a little while; and then, we'll look at it -make sure it doesn't drift off - before we proceed any further.</div>
<div><b>186:36:33 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>186:40:02 Mitchell: </b>Houston, Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>186:40:05 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>186:40:08 Mitchell: </b>Fredo, I'm ready to copy the consumables update.</div>
<div><b>186:40:11 CC: </b>Okay. It's GET of 186 hours; your RCS total, 40 -stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>186:41:00 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. RCS total, 46.2; quad A, 47.0; B, 43.7; C, 47.1; and Delta, 46.9; H^ tanks: 1, 38.1; 2, 36.9; 0^ tank 1, 67*0; and number 2, 68.6; and number 3 is 15.2.</div>
<div><b>186:41:43 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Readback: At GET 186:00; RCS total, 46.2; quads: 47.0, 43.7, 47.1, 46.9; hydrogen: 38.1, 36.9; oxygen: 67.0, 68.6, 15.2.</div>
<div><b>186:42:06 CC: </b>Okay. Good readback.</div>
<div><b>186:42:42 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>186:42:45 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>186:42:47 CC: </b>Okay, looks like that HIGH GAIN has drifted. Would you select MANUAL, and when it's back to your preset knob settings there, go back to REACQ for us; and then select HIGH GAIN; and we'll command it then.</div>
<div><b>186:45:07 Mitchell: </b>Okay,</div>
<div><b>186:45:24 Mitchell: </b>Okay. You got it.</div>
<div><b>186:45:26 CC: </b>Okay, Ed.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>186:46:28 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Houston.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>186:46:39 SC (onboard): </b></div>
<div class="onboard"><b>186:46:46 Shepard (onboard): </b>Okay.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>186:48:37 Mitchell (onboard): </b>. 9</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>186:48:39 Roosa (onboard): </b></div>
<div class="onboard"><b>186:48:44 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Well, don't do it now. Move on.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>186:48:57 Mitchell (onboard): </b>... let me do it,</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>186:55:07 Mitchell (onboard): </b>Very good .</div>
<div><b>186:58:14 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>186:58:24 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>186:58:29 Roosa: </b>Good morning, Bruce. The EMS entry check passed okay.</div>
<div><b>186:58:33 CC: </b>Oh, very good, Stu.</div>
<div><b>187:00:32 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>187:00:36 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>187:00:38 CC: </b>If you could give us a status report on the progress of the inflight demos, especially any that you consider that you've completed, we can release some of the supporting personnel. Over.</div>
<div><b>187:00:52 Roosa: </b>Okay. I guess we need to talk about that. We completed the heat-flow and convection experiment all the way; never did really get too many good results on our Benard cells, but we got some. We finished - essentially, we're finished with all the inflight experiments, with the exception of the metal composites, and we're pressing along through those. And I guess we - we don't require any more support.</div>
<div><b>187:01:30 CC: </b>Okay. Thank you, 14.</div>
<div><b>187:12:51 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>187:12:56 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston; 14.</div>
<div><b>187:12:59 CC: </b>14, our current feeling is that midcourse correction number 6 will probably not be required. However, we'll give you a definite decision on that later on, after we get a little bit more tracking. And we have a procedure for further investigation into the light-flash phenomena, which we'd like to get your feelings on. If we don't burn midcourse 6, we're looking at scheduling a period of something on the order of an hour, starting at about 193:45 or 193:50, for this light-flash investigation, and we're wondering how that fits into your onboard schedule. Over.</div>
<div><b>187:13:50 Roosa: </b>Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>187:14:21 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. Is - If we do skip midcourse 6, why that'll be all right. We'll - we'll take that time for the light flash.</div>
<div><b>187:14:29 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. Out.</div>
<div><b>187:44:30 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>187:44:35 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>187:44:36 CC: </b>14, when you pass out of the region of OMNI Delta coverage, we will ground-command you over to the high gain antenna. At this point, however, you will be in a region where reflections from the spacecraft make acquisition marginal. And, if we - if the antenna is not automatically acquired by the time that you get to the calibration attitude, we would like you to take over and commence a normal acquisition at the optics CAL attitude for us. Over.</div>
<div><b>187:45:14 Roosa: </b>Okay. We'll do that.</div>
<div><b>187:45:19 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>187:45:49 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>187:45:52 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>187:45:54 Roosa: </b>Hey, Bruce. Do you want us to go OMNI Delta now? You know we're on HIGH GAIN now.</div>
<div><b>187:46:01 CC: </b>14, this is Houston - -</div>
<div><b>187:46:02 Roosa: </b>...</div>
<div><b>187:46:03 CC: </b>- - We're controlling your antenna configuration from the ground here. Just leave the configuration on board as is. Over.</div>
<div><b>187:46:11 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>187:48:43 CC: </b>14, Houston. We seem to have acquired a good signal strength. How do you read? Over.</div>
<div><b>187:48:51 Roosa: </b>Loud and clear, Houston; 14.</div>
<div><b>187:48:53 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>187:54:11 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>187:54:17 Shepard: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>187:54:20 CC: </b>14, for Stu, we're receiving a - I guess you could call it a carrier from his biomed, but we?re getting neither the EKG nor the respiration trace. And we wonder if the harness connectors to the signal conditions are properly mated up. Over.</div>
<div><b>187:54:42 Roosa: </b>Just stand by, Bruce. I'll check that.</div>
<div><b>187:54:47 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>187:56:30 CC: </b>Okay. Thank you, Stu.</div>
<div><b>187:56:38 Shepard: </b>Houston, 14. How does the rest of the crew look on biomeds?</div>
<div><b>187:56:40 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Al, you look 4 0 on the biomed. We're not receiving Ed's right now. It looks like he's either turned off or totally disconnected. Over.</div>
<div><b>187:57:11 Shepard: </b>Well, he's not on the air right now, but I was wondering how he looked the last time I saw him yesterday. ...</div>
<div><b>187:57:19 CC: </b>Yes. The surgeon's telling me you - -</div>
<div><b>187:57:20 Shepard: </b>...</div>
<div><b>187:57:22 CC: </b>Surgeon's telling me you all look in great shape, and he wasn't concerned about anything.' He Just wanted to find out what the problem was there, because he was getting something that indicated the signal conditioners and - all that were hooked up - and the TM was turned on, but we weren't getting a signal through on top of the carrier there. Over.</div>
<div><b>187:57:43 Shepard: </b>Okay. Well, Ed and I had had some ... sensor problems earlier, and I just wondered how we were looking now. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>187:57:51 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>188:07:24 Shepard: </b>Houston, 14. How's the downlink look to you now?</div>
<div><b>188:07:30 CC: </b>In what respect, Al? Biomed? Over.</div>
<div><b>188:07:36 Shepard: </b>Negative. TM.</div>
<div><b>188:07:38 CC: </b>Oh, it's looking beautiful to us.</div>
<div><b>188:07:42 Shepard: </b>Okay, we're proceeding. We didn't want you to miss the world's expert on 23 ... here.</div>
<div><b>188:07:48 CC: </b>Oh, we won't. And I - you can tell Stu I made a hard copy of his 00 NOUN 49 yesterday. We'll present it to him, framed, with suitable ceremony.</div>
<div><b>188:08:00 Shepard: </b>Very good. You missed some others while you were gone somewhere else.</div>
<div><b>188:08:05 CC: </b>No, I was here when he made the second one, too, but you don't get a framed certificate for each one.</div>
<div><b>188:08:11 Shepard: </b>Oh, okay.</div>
<div><b>188:11:35 CC: </b>Okay. We copy that one, Stu.</div>
<div><b>188:11:48 CC: </b>Over.</div>
<div><b>188:11:57 Roosa: </b>Roger. Apparently you haven't really taken a look at what 49 should be after long periods of testing. I think we kind of expect that sort of thing, particularly on the first mark.</div>
<div><b>188:12:07 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>188:13:42 CC: </b>14, Houston. The analysis of your first mark there is that that's within about one and a half sigma, and is, indeed, what we expect on the first mark after a period of time such as this. Over.</div>
<div><b>188:13:57 Shepard: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>188:47:37 CC: </b>14, this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>188:47:41 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>188:47:42 CC: </b>Roger. On our telemetry, it looks like you accepted an update this last time on star 4; and our recommendation is that the updates from the first three stars be used for navigation updating, and the last ones - 4, 5, and 6 - just for your own benefit in testing out the P23 techniques, but not for updating the state vector. Over.</div>
<div><b>188:48:09 Roosa: </b>Okay. Sorry about that, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>188:48:12 CC: </b>Also, 14; we've noticed the cabin pressure go up slightly here, over some period of time, and we're wondering if you changed the cabin configuration any. You're up to about 5-7 on our telemetry. Over.</div>
<div><b>188:48:41 Shepard: </b>Houston, we've been testing out a couple of the oxygen masks for a while this morning. That may have done it. We'll keep an eye on it.</div>
<div><b>188:48:51 CC: </b>Roger. It's certainly no problem; you just had the EECOMs a little confused here.</div>
<div><b>188:48:59 Shepard: </b>Well, perhaps the problem was here.</div>
<div><b>189:20:43 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. We show that you're damped out sufficiently to start the spinup at this time. Over.</div>
<div><b>189:20:57 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Houston. We will do that very thing. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>189:21:15 Shepard: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>189:21:17 CC: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>189:21:22 Shepard: </b>Got a little something for you. (Music from "Camelot")</div>
<div><b>189:21:31 Shepard: </b>Oh, I got in on the tail end of that one.</div>
<div><b>189:21:35 CC: </b>I appreciate you thinking about me, Al.</div>
<div><b>189:25:08 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. We'd like to terminate battery Alfa charging at this time. Over.</div>
<div><b>189:25:17 Shepard: </b>Okay. (Music from "Camelot")</div>
<div><b>189:29:09 : </b>(Music from "Camelot")</div>
<div><b>189:38:18 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>189:38:22 Shepard: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>189:38:23 CC: </b>14, we're still working on these docking probe procedures. And we'll give you a call later on today when we've got them finalized. Over.</div>
<div><b>189:38:36 Shepard: </b>Okeydoke, Bruce. That will be fine.</div>
<div><b>189:38:38 CC: </b>And, for our information, can you tell us whether the contingency lunar sample decontamination bag is available in the command module or whether you jettisoned that with the LM? Over.</div>
<div><b>189:38:57 Shepard: </b>Bruce, I'm not sure we can answer that without some looking around. It may be here, or we may have used it. Just a minute.</div>
<div><b>189:39:03 CC: </b>Okay; well, we don't need an answer immediately. We're considering using this bag, if it's available, to go over the head of the docking probe, in order to protect it from any salt spray after splashdown. Over.</div>
<div><b>189:39:18 Shepard: </b>Okay, we'll try and get an answer for you.</div>
<div><b>189:39:20 CC: </b>Thank you.</div>
<div><b>189:40:06 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. On our last request, that won't be required. We've got two other bag candidates that we've identified, and we can use one of them. Over.</div>
<div><b>189:40:20 Mitchell: </b>That'll be fine, if they didn?t go to the same place as the contingency sample bag.</div>
<div><b>189:40:24 CC: </b>No; what we're talking about is one of the temporary stowage bags with the - the purse assembly up at the top cut off - or the bag in which the hoses for the liquid transfer demo are stowed. Over.</div>
<div><b>189:40:43 Mitchell: </b>Okay. We've got another little - got another alternative for you. I can see our shaving kit -razor bag sitting here, or the exerciser bag should be about the same size and work very well.</div>
<div><b>189:41:00 Mitchell: </b>I'm getting some headshakes down here, Ed, that says those bags won't fit over the head of the probe.</div>
<div><b>189:41:11 Mitchell: </b>Neither of them? Doesn't matter to us. We'll put anything over it you like.</div>
<div><b>189:41:20 CC: </b>Okay, we can go and try those out on the mockup. We had not. tried to fit those two bags that you mentioned. We do believe that - we know that the temporary stowage bag or the liquid transfer demo hose bags will fit. We'll get back to you - -</div>
<div><b>189:41:39 Mitchell: </b>Okay, fine. Either one of those will be great.</div>
<div><b>189:41:41 CC: </b>All right; we'll get back to you later on with the finalized procedure. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>189:41:46 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>190:21:45 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>190:21:50 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>190:21:53 CC: </b>In looking at your flight-plan activities for this afternoon, since we are still holding on the final probe stowage procedures, we're wondering how you'd feel about doing some of the light-flash stuff during the next hour here. Over.</div>
<div><b>190:22:22 Shepard: </b>I thought we originally discussed that as a replacement for the midcourse.</div>
<div><b>190:22:27 CC: </b>We did. However, we're now looking at the possibility of getting the probe tied down, roughly in this time period, instead. And one of the items that we're going to use, - or planning to use in tying down the probe is a rendezvous window shade, and it would be hard to get good dark adaptation inside after using the window shade as a shim. Over.</div>
<div><b>190:23:02 Shepard: </b>It would also be hard to sleep this evening after using the rendezvous window shade as a shim.</div>
<div><b>190:23:32 CC: </b>Roger, 14. But looking ahead in the time line for the activities coming up tomorrow - that is, after your sleep period this evening, it looks like you're going to be relatively busy, and we'd like to allocate about an hour, or maybe even a little more, to - to getting the probe configured and properly tied down in its position. And, I guess, if - We've been looking for a good place to fit that in, and we don't see an obvious slot in tomorrow's flight plan, although we could take another look at rearranging things somewhat. Over.</div>
<div><b>190:24:18 Shepard: </b>Oh, I completely agree. I think we ought to get the probe stowed today and forget about it, Hold on just a minute; we'll look at the flight plan.</div>
<div><b>190:24:25 CC: </b>There's a possibility we could rig some sort of a temporary window shade that might not give you complete blackness, but it could be - say, taped in place and would make it dark enough inside for sleeping. Over.</div>
<div><b>190:24:45 Shepard: </b>Well, perhaps - possibly, you could put the window shade in place under the probe, get the ... on it, and remove it tonight, and then slip it back in tomorrow as the last step, and put it down with ...</div>
<div><b>190:25:07 CC: </b>As I say, Al, we haven't got the final procedure bought off on yet; but, looking at the interim one here, the present location of it would be underneath a book from the flight data file and on top of a sleeping bag down on the aft heat shield, with the probe strapped down pretty tightly against it, using the window cover to spread out the force from one of the pitch arms, so that it doesn't concentrate excessively on the aft heatshield - so that if you get it tied down very securely, it may be difficult to get that window shil [sic] - window shade in and out after tying it down. Over.</div>
<div><b>190:25:52 Shepard: </b>Okay. Well, how's about looking at something else in place of the window shade, because we'd like to get a good night's sleep tonight, if we can.</div>
<div><b>190:26:00 CC: </b>Okay. We'll look at it.</div>
<div><b>190:29:22 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>190:29:27 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>190:29:29 CC: </b>Okay; back to our original question. Under the assumption that we are not yet ready to stow the probe, would you all be agreeable to trying some of this light-flash observation, at the present time or after you finish eating? Over.</div>
<div><b>190:29:59 Shepard: </b>Okay. We'll go ahead and do it now, if you'd like.</div>
<div><b>190:30:04 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>190:30:26 Shepard: </b>Houston. Do we want to use the - DSE, the voice loop, or how do you want us to record this info?</div>
<div><b>190:30:35 CC: </b>I think we might as well use the voice loop. You can just send it down under the assumption that we?re on good comm here.</div>
<div><b>190:30:48 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>190:30:50 CC: </b>Okay. The objectives stated for this period of observations are, first off, to confirm that it is not necessary to be dark-adapted to see the flashes; secondly, to collect the real-time data on the times of occurrence of different types of flash; and, lastly, to determine if there's any other sensory effect associated with this phenomenon. Over.</div>
<div><b>190:31:16 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>190:31:20 CC: </b>You're requested to - you're requested to become thoroughly light-adapted, that is, by looking at a flashlight. Then relax, start the dark-adaptation procedure, and report and describe flashes as they occur.</div>
<div><b>190:32:08 CC: </b>14, Houston. How do you read now?</div>
<div><b>190:32:13 Shepard: </b>Okay, Bruce. We lost you right after you started talking about the procedure.</div>
<div><b>190:32:18 CC: </b>Okay. You should configure the cabin so that you can, indeed, start the dark-adaptation procedure. And in starting the procedure, you are asked to become thoroughly light-adapted, as by looking at a flashlight or floodlight. Then relax, start the dark adaptation, and report and describe flashes as they occur. Marking the time of the occurrence of the flash takes priority over detailed description. One of you should continue observations, dark-adapted, as long as possible. The others should - expose themselves to light again after about 25 minutes, and we'11 give you a cue on that. And repeat the experiment for another 10 minutes -as many cycles as you feel you have time for, in order to increase our probability of getting flash observations during the early portion of the dark-adaptation transients. We?d also like to hear from you commentary on any other unusual physical sensations , such as tingling or apparent sounds of unusual character - like ringing in the ears, and so forth. Over.</div>
<div><b>190:33:31 Shepard: </b>How did all that get into it?</div>
<div><b>190:33:36 CC: </b>Well, it's what our investigator has decided he's interested in. Over,</div>
<div><b>190:33:43 Shepard: </b>I mean, these things aren't timebombs going off in your head, you know.</div>
<div><b>190:33:46 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>190:33:51 Shepard: </b>Just being facetious, Bruce. We'll cooperate.</div>
<div><b>190:33:54 CC: </b>Okay (laughter). And along those lines, he's looking for the following data on the flashes: the type of flash, i.e., star streak, nova, et cetera; brightness; the location in your visual field; color, if any; and whether it's possible to distinguish or not which eye the flash seems to occur in. Over.</div>
<div><b>190:34:22 Shepard: </b>Okay. We understand.</div>
<div><b>190:34:24 CC: </b>And let us know when you start dark-adapting each time, and we'll time it for you. Over.</div>
<div><b>190:34:31 Shepard: </b>Okay. We have the - window shades in now.</div>
<div><b>190:34:42 CC: </b>And, just for reference, we're playing back the video tapes of your last evening's - inflight demonstration TV show for about the fifth time down here. I think you're going to be a best seller.</div>
<div><b>190:34:57 Shepard: </b>Oh, really. Glad to hear it.</div>
<div><b>190:37:04 Shepard: </b>Okay, Houston, let's review what we intend to do here just a second. Okay, we have all three on now, and we're going to - we have the window shades in; the cabin lights are currently on. At T^, all three of us shine a flashlight in our eyes, turn out all the lights, and that's the start of the sequence. Stu and I'll recycle about once every 10 minutes, and Ed keeps going as long as he can stay awake. Is that correct?</div>
<div><b>190:37:44 CC: </b>14, Houston. That's correct, except that on the first batch we'd like to keep you all in the dark-adaptation procedure for about 25 minutes and then have two of you start recycling at 10-minute intervals . Over.</div>
<div><b>190:38:05 Shepard: </b>Understand you want all three for 25 minutes.</div>
<div><b>190:38:06 CC: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>190:38:09 Shepard: </b>And then all three recycling.</div>
<div><b>190:38:19 CC: </b>Negative. One crewman, whom you can determine amongst you, should, when he starts the dark-adaptation procedure, continue in the dark-adapted condition until the termination of the experiment. The other two of you should do this light-adaptation again after 25 minutes and then recycle on a 10-minute basis. Over.</div>
<div><b>190:38:47 Shepard: </b>Okay. Well, it looks to me like we'll probably have time for one 25-minute cycle. And that's probably about it. We have a P52 coming up here at 192:10.</div>
<div><b>190:39:04 CC: </b>Roger. We see that in the flight plan.</div>
<div><b>190:39:10 Shepard: </b>Okay. All right, all three of us will go for 25 minutes and Ed'11 continue on; and we'll discuss how the other two will go from there.</div>
<div><b>190:39:17 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>190:39:20 Shepard: </b>Give me long enough to get the flashlights ready. We'll give you a mark here in about 40 seconds.</div>
<div><b>190:39:50 Shepard: </b>Okay, Tq will be 191:20:00, Here we go.</div>
<div><b>190:39:55 CC: </b>Roger. Out. Minus 1 second and counting - -</div>
<div><b>190:39:58 Shepard: </b>Okay -</div>
<div><b>190:39:59 Shepard: </b>MARK.</div>
<div><b>190:40:15 Shepard: </b>Okay. It's all dark.</div>
<div><b>190:56:00 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Nothing heard for 16 minutes. Over.</div>
<div><b>190:56:07 Shepard: </b>That's correct.</div>
<div><b>190:56:21 Mitchell: </b>Not only correct, but unusual, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>190:56:26 CC: </b>Run that one by again - -</div>
<div><b>190:56:27 Mitchell: </b>It's almost unbelievable, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>190:56:33 CC: </b>Run that one by again, please, Ed.</div>
<div><b>190:56:39 Mitchell: </b>I say it's unusual; I think most of us see them long before now.</div>
<div><b>190:56:57 Shepard: </b>Well, if we don't see anything by 20 minutes, I suggest we terminate - and try to give you some more qualitative information during tonight's sleep period.</div>
<div><b>190:57:11 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>190:57:12 Mitchell: </b>MARK. A faint star - left eye at - 10 o?clock.</div>
<div><b>190:57:23 CC: </b>Roger. Faint star, left eye, at 10 o'clock.</div>
<div><b>190:57:43 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>190:57:44 Shepard: </b>MARK. Vertical trace, right eye.</div>
<div><b>190:57:48 CC: </b>Roger, Al.</div>
<div><b>190:57:50 Shepard: </b>Nine o'clock. Nine o'clock.</div>
<div><b>190:58:26 Mitchell: </b>High and left to lower right.</div>
<div><b>190:58:31 CC: </b>Roger, Ed. You have a color on any of these?</div>
<div><b>190:58:35 Mitchell: </b>Say again.</div>
<div><b>190:58:36 CC: </b>Do you have a color on these?</div>
<div><b>190:58:42 Mitchell: </b>These have both been white so far.</div>
<div><b>190:58:44 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>190:58:54 Shepard: </b>Houston. We all have a consensus that we've never seen anything that's colored.</div>
<div><b>190:59:01 CC: </b>Roger. Out.</div>
<div><b>190:59:36 Mitchell: </b>MARK. It is a cloud at 12 o'clock, high, left eye.</div>
<div><b>190:59:40 CC: </b>Roger, Ed.</div>
<div><b>190:59:44 Shepard: </b>MARK. Right eye, 8 o'clock, low, single flash.</div>
<div><b>190:59:52 CC: </b>Roger, Al.</div>
<div><b>190:59:57 CC: </b>How's the redheaded cosmic ray detector doing?</div>
<div><b>191:00:02 Mitchell: </b>He's asleep, I think.</div>
<div><b>191:00:03 Roosa: </b>Not - must not be my time for starry</div>
<div><b>191:00:09 Mitchell: </b>He's down in the LEB. He's shielded by the nav base.</div>
<div><b>191:01:09 Mitchell: </b>MARK. 10 o'clock - about level; it was a - a double star.</div>
<div><b>191:01:20 CC: </b>Roger, Ed.</div>
<div><b>191:01:23 Mitchell: </b>And it was the left eye; and, believe it or not, it had kind of a bluish tint to it.</div>
<div><b>191:01:29 CC: </b>Roger, Ed.</div>
<div><b>191:01:32 Mitchell: </b>Yes. It was - it looked more like a blue diamond. You know, very white, but with a blue cast.</div>
<div><b>191:01:41 CC: </b>Roger, Ed.</div>
<div><b>191:02:30 Shepard: </b>MARK. Left eye, single flash, 9 o'clock.</div>
<div><b>191:02:33 CC: </b>Roger, A1.</div>
<div><b>191:03:01 Mitchell: </b>MARK. Streak, left eye, 12 o'clock, low; and it was going from the bottom toward the top.</div>
<div><b>191:03:30 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Twenty-three minutes and 34 seconds into the test. And at 25 minutes, we would like Ed, and Ed only, to shine the flashlight in his eyes long enough to ruin his dark adaptation, and then start the dark-adaptation procedure again. We'd like to be sure that you don't shine the flashlight in anybody else's eyes.</div>
<div><b>191:03:58 Mitchell: </b>Well, they'll just have to close their eyes then, I guess.</div>
<div><b>191:04:03 CC: </b>Okay. I'll give you a hack at 25 minutes.</div>
<div><b>191:04:14 Mitchell: </b>Only been seeing on my left eye. Should I just dark-adapt that one?</div>
<div><b>191:04:24 Shepard: </b>MARK. Low at 6 o'clock, and it was a double flash, left eye.</div>
<div><b>191:04:33 CC: </b>Roger. All right, Ed. Let's not - let?s not go halfway. Let's do the whole job. You can - light up both your eyeballs. And - we're 24 minutes 50 seconds and counting.</div>
<div><b>191:04:53 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>191:04:55 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>191:04:57 CC: </b>MARK. Twenty-five minutes, and let us know when you turn the light back out.</div>
<div><b>191:05:17 Mitchell: </b>Okay. The light's out.</div>
<div><b>191:05:21 CC: </b>Roger, Ed.</div>
<div><b>191:05:32 Mitchell: </b>I don't think I'll see anything for days after that one.</div>
<div><b>191:06:09 Mitchell: </b>MARK. Right eye at - It'd be 3 o'clock, low, and it was a streak; went from right to left.</div>
<div><b>191:06:21 CC: </b>Roger, Ed. That was about 51 seconds when you called mark.</div>
<div><b>191:06:26 Shepard: </b>MARK. Left eye - Yes, I had a mark right in the middle of that conversation. Left eye, 12 o'clock high, single flash.</div>

<div><b>191:14:56 CC: </b>Say again the last part of that, Ed. We - -</div>
<div><b>191:14:58 Roosa: </b>MARK.</div>
<div><b>191:14:59 CC: </b>- - You blurred it out.</div>
<div><b>191:15:02 Mitchell: </b>Two o'clock, level.</div>
<div><b>191:15:07 Roosa: </b>During that one, I had a cloud at 11 o'clock.</div>
<div><b>191:15:20 Shepard: </b>MARK. Left eye, 9 o'clock, down at the bottom.</div>
<div><b>191:15:25 CC: </b>Roger, Al.</div>
<div><b>191:15:58 CC: </b>Ed, this is Houston. We?d like you to repeat the exposure of your li - eyeballs to light cycle and then start readapting again. We want Stu and Al to continue in the dark-adapted condition. Over.</div>
<div><b>191:16:14 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>191:16:17 Shepard: </b>How much longer do you project this to run, Bruce?</div>
<div><b>191:16:27 CC: </b>Say again, Al.</div>
<div><b>191:16:31 Shepard: </b>MARK. Right eye. I wonder if that was Ed's flashlight. How much longer you think you're going to be running this test?</div>
<div><b>191:16:41 CC: </b>A total of about 10 minutes more. And then we'll come out, and Stu can start the P52 and we'll be back in business.</div>
<div><b>191:16:51 Shepard: </b>Okay. Sounds good.</div>
<div><b>191:16:52 CC: </b>Roger. Currently, I've got 191 plus 57, or 13 minutes , until the block in the flight plan for starting the P52. So I think we're still in good shape.</div>
<div><b>191:17:06 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>191:17:07 Mitchell: </b>MARK, Bruce. I'm starting my adaptation again.</div>

<div><b>191:19:05 CC: </b>Okay. We got those, Ed.</div>
<div><b>191:19:22 Shepard: </b>For your documentation on spacecraft orientation, A1 is in the - left couch looking up; Ed is in the right couch looking up; and Stu's in the LEB facing Mecca.</div>
<div><b>191:19:37 GC: </b>Understand. Stu is in the LEB facing the nav base?</div>
<div><b>191:19:46 Shepard: </b>To each his own.</div>
<div><b>191:19:51 Roosa: </b>No. I'm - I'm floating in LEB, Bruce. But it's -I'm looking toward plus-X.</div>
<div><b>191:19:58 CC: </b>Roger. We couldn't find Mecca on the stowage list there.</div>
<div><b>191:20:35 Mitchell: </b>MARK. Flash, right eye, at 12 o?clock, level.</div>

<div><b>191:22:19 Mitchell: </b>MARK. Flash, right eye, 3 o'clock.</div>
<div><b>191:22:25 CC: </b>Roger, Ed. And - 14, this is Houston. We have a - a query here, wondering how long, in terms of angular measurement, those streaks are? Over. I should say, apparent angular measurement.</div>
<div><b>191:22:46 Mitchell: </b>Mine are abo - mine have been about half an eyeball diameter from - -</div>
<div><b>191:22:53 Shepard: </b>MARK. Double shot in the right eye, at 10 o'clock and 7 o'clock.</div>

<div><b>191:26:22 Roosa: </b>MARK. Flash, 2 o'clock, on the periphery , right eye.</div>
<div><b>191:26:30 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>191:27:18 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. We're going to terminate the light-flash investigation at this time. We would like to convey our appreciation to all three of you for cooperating in the investigation. The investigators are very happy with the data that you have given them, and I think they will be able to get something significant out of it. Over.</div>
<div><b>191:27:41 Roosa: </b>MARK. Flash, at 1 o'clock, on the periphery.</div>
<div><b>191:27:46 CC: </b>Roger, 14. We can terminate the experiment and proceed with the P52, Stu.</div>
<div><b>191:27:53 Roosa: </b>Okay. And, Bruce, I'd just like to make a comment. I don?t know whether it's my position down in LEB or why, but even with those up in the couches, that's not near as many flashes as I've seen at other times.</div>
<div><b>191:28:08 Mitchell: </b>Yes. And I was going to remark, Bruce, that most of the times when I've observed them have been after sleep. Generally, I guess I fall asleep so fast when we turn in that there's not time to observe them. But they always seem very bright, much brighter than right now - than they were this pass. I don't know whether more numerous - perhaps more numerous - but always brighter than they were today.</div>
<div><b>191:28:36 CC: </b>Roger. We copy that, Ed. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>191:28:41 Mitchell: </b>Did you get Stu? He concurs on that, he said.</div>
<div><b>191:28:43 Roosa: </b>Yes. I said on the intercom that I agree to that, also, Bruce. Like last night - I was laying there and there were just, you know, big bright ones all over the place. And these, seemed like, were a little subdued compared to that.</div>
<div><b>191:29:03 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>191:29:06 Shepard: </b>Well, let's see, that should put us at about 104 percent completion of the flight-plan items.</div>
<div><b>191:29:16 CC: </b>I'll run that one by the FA0, and see what he's got to say.</div>
<div><b>191:30:31 CC: </b>14, a brief update on things. We have canceled midcourse correction number 6 at this time. Based on our tracking, the preliminary estimates are that midcourse 7 will not be required. However, we won't be able to make that decision with certainty until tomorrow. Based on MSFN tracking, your gamma at entry interface is minus 6.35 degrees. Based on your onboard navigated state vector, it's minus 6.68. So we're showing very good agreement there.</div>
<div><b>191:31:17 Roosa: </b>Say the MSFN angle again, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>191:31:20 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. The MSFN angle is minus 6.35- The angle derived from your onboard navigated state vector is minus 6.68. Over.</div>
<div><b>191:31:33 Roosa: </b>Okay. These should come together as the marks continue, shouldn't they?</div>
<div><b>191:31:41 CC: </b>That's our expectation, Stu.</div>
<div><b>191:33:57 CC: </b>Okay, Stu, we've got them. And they look good.</div>
<div><b>191:34:03 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>191:34:20 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce, and we'll torque at 192:14:25.</div>
<div><b>191:34:26 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. Run that time by again, please.</div>
<div><b>191:34:34 Roosa: </b>192:14:25.</div>
<div><b>191:34:37 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>192:44:40 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>192:44:44 MS: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>192:44:49 CC: </b>Stand by.</div>
<div><b>192:44:55 Mitchell: </b>Say again, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>192:45:30 Roosa: </b>Hey, Bruce - -</div>
<div><b>192:45:31 Mitchell: </b>14. Did you call?</div>
<div><b>192:45:35 CC: </b>Roger, 14. This is Houston. We would like you to go to an attitude for thermal control, not PTC, and maintain that attitude until beginning of the TV coverage for the press conference; and that attitude is roll, 262; pitch, 090; yaw, 000. Over.</div>
<div><b>192:46:06 Mitchell: </b>Roger. 262, 090, 000.</div>
<div><b>192:46:10 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>192:46:13 Mitchell: </b>And we'11 do it.</div>
<div><b>192:56:53 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Request you terminate the waste water dump now in progress. Over.</div>
<div><b>192:59:07 CC: </b>Apollo 14 - -</div>
<div><b>192:59:08 Mitchell: </b></div>
<div><b>192:59:09 CC: </b>- - This is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>192:59:14 Mitchell: </b>Yes, Bruce; we've turned it off now.</div>
<div><b>192:59:16 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>193:00:38 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. When you can give us P00 and ACCEPT, we have a state vector and a clock update for you. Over. - Or uplink.</div>
<div><b>193:00:50 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce; you've got it.</div>
<div><b>193:00:52 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. You?re very weak.</div>
<div><b>193:00:59 Roosa: </b>Well, how now? Maybe it works better if I talk into the mike. We're P00 and ACCEPT.</div>
<div><b>193:01:04 CC: </b>That comes through a lot better.</div>
<div><b>193:01:17 CC: </b>And, for your information, Stu, based On your last set of P23s, your navigated state vector has a gamma at entry interface of minus 6.74; MSFN solution of minus 6.35 remains unchanged. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:01:39 Roosa: </b>Well, didn't sound like it helped us much.</div>
<div><b>193:01:45 CC: </b>Well, you might be right; who knows?</div>
<div><b>193:01:52 Mitchell: </b>Say, Bruce. Observe the HIGH GAIN starting to oscillate. What would you like to do with it?</div>
<div><b>193:02:02 CC: </b>Yes; they tell me you're on OMNI Delta right now. We'll get you something to do with the HIGH GAIN.</div>
<div><b>193:02:10 Mitchell: </b>If we're on OMNI Delta, It's news to me.</div>
<div><b>193:02:20 CC: </b>Stand by, please.</div>
<div><b>193:03:07 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We've uplink commanded you to OMNI Delta. We'd like you to park the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA at PITCH, minus 52; YAW, 270. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:03:22 Mitchell: </b>Wilco.</div>
<div><b>193:03:24 CC: </b>And I have a brief flight-plan update for you, when you're ready to copy.</div>
<div><b>193:03:33 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>193:03:38 CC: </b>Okay. Do not go into PTC until a GET of 198 plus 45. Over,</div>
<div><b>193:04:04 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Do not go to PTC until 198 plus 45. Understand.</div>
<div><b>193:04:08 CC: </b>Okay. At 194 plus 50, a VERB 49 maneuver to the TV attitude, which is roll, 325, 090, 000. In that attitude, HIGH GAIN ANTENNA, PITCH, plus 32; YAW, 270. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:04:47 Mitchell: </b>Okay. At - 194 plus 50: VERB 49 to TV attitude; pitch is 325, 090, 000, with HIGH GAIN - angles of 32 and 270.</div>

<div><b>193:05:39 Mitchell: </b>Understand; TV, 195:07 to 195:37*</div>
<div><b>193:05:46 CC: </b>Readback correct. That completes the flight-plan update, and the computer's yours. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:05:55 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. The computer's mine, and how about me going to WIDE DEAD BAND here - while we're setting here and until after the TV show.</div>
<div><b>193:06:10 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. We concur. And I'll have a - -</div>
<div><b>193:06:15 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>193:06:17 CC: </b>- - an entry pad here for you shortly. And then we'll be ready to start in on the great probe stowage exercise.</div>
<div><b>193:06:27 Roosa: </b>All right.</div>
<div><b>193:10:12 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. I have an entry pad and a CSM state vector pad for you. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:10:21 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Stand by.</div>
<div><b>193:11:07 Mitchell: </b>We're ready to copy the entry pad, Bruce.</div>

<div><b>193:23:19 Roosa: </b>Okay. State vector, VERB 71. 2 - 200 hours on the money; index 21, 01501. How do you read, Bruce?</div>
<div><b>193:23:37 CC: </b>Okay. I was reading you before, and I have my volume all the way turned up here. Now, I really read you, Stu.</div>
<div><b>193:23:45 Roosa: </b>Oh, okay. I just realized that my mike had -wasn't right. I'll start on 02: 01501, 00001, 74563; 62354, 10577, 10424; 03452, 14667, 00467; 37210, 73721; 60164, 75626, 44713; 10452, 21000.</div>
<div><b>193:24:29 CC.: </b>Roger, 14. Readback is correct.</div>
<div><b>193:24:34 Roosa: </b>Okay. Thank you, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>193:26:11 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We're ready to go on the probe stowage at the present time. However, it was our intent to give you about a half an hour of free time prior to commencing the TV pass for the press conference to let you get configured in whatever mode you want up there. So, we've got a couple of breakpoints in this procedure; and, if you concur, we could start into this and give it about 30-minutes' worth and then knock it off for the TV show. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:26:21 Mitchell: </b>Roger. Reading you.</div>
<div><b>193:26:23 Shepard: </b>Yes. About all we have to do to configure for the TV show is to get the camera set up. And, actually, Stu and I will be stowing the probe, and Ed could be setting up the camera, so we can work simultaneously.</div>
<div><b>193:26:35 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>193:27:47 CC: </b>14, this is Houston, As a preliminary to the probe stowage proper, we'd like to review a few stowage items for entry with you. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:28:02 Roosa: </b>Okay, go ahead.</div>
<div><b>193:28:03 CC: </b>Okay, you might get up a little closer - -</div>
<div><b>193:28:05 Shepard: </b>... do all this - Can do all this in real time, now. We don't have to write anything down. Is that right?</div>
<div><b>193:28:13 CC: </b>That's correct. The first few steps will be probably informational rather than anything else; and then, we'll get into the real-time stuff.</div>
<div><b>193:28:43 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>193:28:47 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>193:28:49 CC: </b>It's our understanding that you have two decontamination bags at the present time, one weighing about 20 pounds and one weighing about 30 pounds. The 30-pound decontamination bag and contents should be stowed on top of locker Alfa-13 for entry, using the existing tiedown rings. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:29:16 Roosa: </b>Stand by 1, a minute, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>193:29:18 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>193:29:40 Shepard: </b>Give us about 5 minutes, Bruce, and we'll have the A-10 in shape for you here. Stand by.</div>
<div><b>193:29:46 CC: </b>Okay, now. Before you do too much with the A-10 situation, it's our understanding that you currently have a 20-pound bag on top of A-10; and we're going to ask you to move that over to the top of A?8 for entry. And, of course, once you lash this down on top of A-8, which is not necessary to do right now, you're locking your inflight demo, the composite casting, into place there; and you want to be sure and get as far through that as it is your intention to do prior to lashing down A-8. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:30:24 Shepard: </b>Okay. We understand that.</div>
<div><b>193:32:15 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. Now, let's go back to the bag that you want on A-13. Make sure I've got that one.</div>
<div><b>193:32:21 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. We want the 30-pound decontamination bag on top of A-13 for entry. It is not necessary to lash this down at the present time unless you so desire. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:32:40 Roosa: </b>Okay. We'll put the 30-pounder on top of A-13, and we?ll lash it down at our convenience.</div>
<div><b>193:32:47 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>193:32:48 Roosa: </b>And I guess we're ready to press when you are, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>193:32:51 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. Then, we're going to have the 20-pound decontamination bag on top of A-8 for entry; and again, it's not necessary to lash this down yet. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:34:08 Roosa: </b>Okay. Twenty pounder on A-8.</div>
<div><b>193:34:11 CC: </b>Next, it's intended to stow the IV pressure garment assembly, that is, yours, with its helmet in a sleeping bag on top of the 28 - on top of the 20-pound bag on A-8. Use LM webbing and the D-rings on the container for tiedowns. Once again this can be delayed. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:34:54 Roosa: </b>Okay. And we'll put my suit, with helmet, gloves in a sleeping bag and tie them on top of the 20-pounder on A-8.</div>
<div><b>193:35:04 CC: </b>Roger. Then, after that's all through, you need to verify a minimal 4-inch clearance to the couch. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:35:12 Roosa: </b>Okay. Four-inch clearance to the couch.</div>
<div><b>193:35:15 CC: </b>Okay. Now then, we need you in real time here to go through locker Alfa-10 and remove anything that may be needed later on in the flight - prior to entry, such as 70-millimeter magazines, Reseau camera, or whatever you feel you'll require. Over</div>
<div><b>193:35:41 Roosa: </b>Okay. Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>193:35:49 CC: </b>And, Stu, one item that we'd like you to remove from A-10 at this time is the bag that contains the hoses for the liquid-transfer demonstration. Over. And that's - that's just the bag because we're going to place the bag over the probe head later on and tape it in place; so, you'd want to leave the hoses in A-10.</div>
<div><b>193:36:17 Roosa: </b>Okay. That clarifies that.</div>
<div><b>193:40:55 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. A-10 is secured to our satisfaction.</div>
<div><b>193:41:01 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. And now, in locker Alfa-5, we'd like you to remove the headrest pads and install them on the couches. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:41:12 Roosa: </b>Okay, in work.</div>
<div><b>193:41:15 CC: </b>Also, the heel clips and five ropes, while you're down there temporarily.</div>
<div><b>193:41:23 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>193:42:58 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. That's accomplished.</div>
<div><b>193:43:02 CC: </b>Okay. You've got the heel clips and the ropes and the headrest pads out and installed on the couch. Okay.</div>
<div><b>193:43:11 Roosa: </b>21 Nancy.</div>
<div><b>193:43:12 CC: </b>Roger. And we want everything else removed from the right-hand side of A-5, that is, the cushion and added equipment that's in there and stow that in Bravo-1, the main food locker there. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:43:29 Roosa: </b>In work.</div>
<div><b>193:45:45 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. A-5 is all clean.</div>
<div><b>193:45:52 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. Now, we'd like you to remove the two lithium hydroxide canisters from Alfa-6 and place them in the left-hand side of Alfa-5. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:46:05 Roosa: </b>In work.</div>
<div><b>193:46:09 CC: </b>And while you're over there in Alfa-6, you might as well get all the rest of the stuff, the TV equipment, out of it.</div>
<div><b>193:46:19 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>193:47:30 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>193:47:33 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>193:47:36 Roosa: </b>Okay. Now, you want the cushion out of the right side of A-6. Is that affirmative? Or just the TV gear?</div>
<div><b>193:47:45 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. It's not required that you take the cushion out of the right-hand side of - or out of A-6. We do want the TV gear out. Ultimately, we're going to stow the TV equipment from Alfa-6 in the Bravo-1 food locker with the monitor wrapped in a constant wear garment; but since we're coining up on the press conference, you want to keep it out for operation at the present time. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:48:26 Roosa: </b>Okay. So, we now have A-6 completely empty, except for the cushion in the right side.</div>
<div><b>193:48:32 CC: </b>That's affirmative. And Alfa-5 ought to have two lithium hydroxide canisters in the left-hand side of it, and the right-hand side of it ought to be completely empty. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:48:44 Roosa: </b>Okay. We are in that configuration.</div>
<div><b>193:48:50 CC: </b>Roger. Now, we need somebody that is qualified to tie knots.</div>
<div><b>193:48:56 Roosa: </b>Okay. As I said before, we've got two sailors.</div>
<div><b>193:49:01 CC: </b>Okay. We want you to double one of the sleep-restraint ropes and to tie it to the plus-Y, plus-Z footpad on the aft bulkhead belonging to locker Alfa-6. As a preliminary, you should remove the urine bag from under Alfa-6 to allow you to get under there with one hand. You can put a hand underneath and a hand around the side toward panel 250, and this is the plus-Y, plus-Z-ward footpad of Alfa-6, and it's the one that's closest to panel 250 down there in the corner. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:49:46 Roosa: </b>Okay. So we should take the bag completely out from underneath, right?</div>
<div><b>193:49:50 CC: </b>Roger. You can restow that back in there after you get the rope tied on, but it makes access a lot easier if it's out for this step.</div>
<div><b>193:50:01 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>193:50:04 CC: </b>And you want to - to tie the knot, using as little of the line as is convenient, probably a bowline or something like that to - the thing going to come up and tie around part of the probe.</div>
<div><b>193:50:21 Roosa: </b>In work.</div>
<div><b>193:50:22 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>193:50:56 Shepard: </b>Okay. Do you want this thing outside the footpad or inside the footpad?</div>
<div><b>193:51:04 CC: </b>Okay. We would like it trending through the space between the Alfa-6 locker and the waste management panel, so I guess it - that would probably be outside.</div>
<div><b>193:53:31 Shepard: </b>On the loose end of this line, do you want a bight or do you want just the bitter ends?</div>
<div><b>193:53:37 CC: </b>On the loose end of it, Al, which is really a double end as I assume you're tying it on, there is no particular requirement. You're Just going to tie the - the doubled-up piece of line around a part of the probe later on. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:53:57 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>193:54:33 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. That step is completed.</div>
<div><b>193:54:37 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. Then, we want you to take the three ropes that you've removed from A-5 there and tie one end of all three, either collectively or one at a time, to the A-6 aft bulkhead footpad; that's in the plus-Y, minus-Z direction. That's the one on the box there that's farther - It's closer to the side hatch than the one you Just tied the one doubled-up rope around. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:55:15 Roosa: </b>Okay. You want three ropes, the ends tied around that one. That's four.</div>
<div><b>193:55:21 CC: </b>That's correct. You're going to come off of there with effectively a triple strand of line, the full length. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:56:54 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. We've got three more snakes on the loose. So you can - -</div>
<div><b>193:57:00 CC: </b>Okay. Now that you've got the additional snakes tied to Alfa-6, you can put the urine bag back underneath it, unless you anticipate needing this assembly prior to entry.</div>
<div><b>193:57:14 Roosa: </b>Okay. We'll put it back underneath it.</div>
<div><b>193:57:16 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>193:57:43 Roosa: </b>Okay. Let's press.</div>
<div><b>193:57:48 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. All right, now, we'd like to move over to the probe and ensure that the probe - umbilical power connectors are connected to the shorting plugs and that the probe is fully folded. Over.</div>
<div><b>193:58:06 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'll verify that.</div>
<div><b>193:58:11 CC: </b>Is that an in work or an accomplished?</div>
<div><b>193:58:15 Roosa: </b>Well, I verified those - those steps, but we're going to have to stand by right now, here. We're going to have to get the probe down out of the tunnel.</div>
<div><b>193:58:23 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>193:59:46 Roosa: </b>Okay. We have the probe.</div>
<div><b>193:59:50 CC: </b>Okay. Ask ole 21 Nancy there if he'll verify that the probe connectors are connected to the shorting plugs and that the probe is fully folded.</div>
<div><b>194:00:01 Roosa: </b>Well, the umbilicals are connected to the shorting plugs, and I don't know if there's something in there that1s fully folded; you know, the probe ' s folded up as you bring it out of the - out of the tunnel.</div>
<div><b>194:00:20 CC: </b>Okay, and Stu - -</div>
<div><b>194:00:21 Roosa: </b>I haven't done anything other than just - just a normal probe removal.</div>
<div><b>194:00:25 CC: </b>Yes, you might check to make sure that the old Teflon block there on the side is against the ratchet housing in - on the arm there that engages in the tunnel.</div>
<div><b>194:00:43 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>194:01:50 Roosa: </b>Bruce, are you waiting on us?</div>
<div><b>194:01:55 CC: </b>Affirmative.</div>
<div><b>194:01:58 Roosa: </b>Okay. We're - we're ready to go. The probe's folded.</div>
<div><b>194:02:01 CC: </b>Okay. We?d like you to take two of the nominal 8-and-a-half-by-ll-size Flight Data File Books and tape them to the base or the capture latch release handle under the probe. We've got tape in R-6, and it's your option as to which pubs you use; probably, the CSM Rescue Book and the CMP Solo Book or the Lunar Landmark Maps would be good candidates.</div>
<div><b>194:02:30 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>194:02:50 CC: </b>And, just by way of information, when we get this stowed, these pubs are going to come to rest against the right-hand equipment bay panel, down there to the - to the right of 251.</div>
<div><b>194:03:08 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>194:03:25 Shepard: </b>Okay. We have the CSM Lunar Landmark Map Book, which is about five-eighths of an inch thick. Is that satisfactory?</div>
<div><b>194:03:33 CC: </b>Roger. That should be satisfactory by itself.</div>
<div><b>194:04:31 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. We have a book in hand and ready to go.</div>
<div><b>194:04:35 CC: </b>Okay. You want to place that across the base end of the - the probe assembly there, across the capture latch release handle; and this is going to be the padding that distributes the load a little bit from the base end of the probe assembly onto the paneling down there in the right-hand equipment bay, hatchwise from panel 252; so, you just want to tape it across the base there, so that it'll be sure and stay in position. Over.</div>
<div><b>194:05:07 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>194:07:47 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. The book is taped to the base of the probe.</div>
<div><b>194:07:52 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. And what we'd like you to do next is to place a bag over the probe head, and the latest information shows that that liquid transfer demo hose bag probably will not fit; and, therefore, you can stow that either in Bravo-1 or - or back in Alfa-10; your option. And we're recommending that you take an unused temporary stowage bag, that is, one that's not currently in use, and cut the mechanism off the top of the temporary stowage bag, place that over the probe head, and tape it in place. Over.</div>
<div><b>194:08:49 CC: </b>What we're trying to do here is protect the mechanism in the probe head against possible salt water or salt spray splashing in during the recovery. Over.</div>
<div><b>194:09:02 Shepard: </b>Okay. We're just looking around; the temporary stowage bags are all filled at the moment. Hold on.</div>
<div><b>194:09:19 CC: </b>And, 14; Houston. Since you don't have anything else to do right now, why, we?d like you to press on to the TV attitude, 325, 090, and 000, and acquire on the HIGH GAIN when we get there. Over.</div>
<div><b>194:09:35 Shepard: </b>Okay. 325, 090, 0 - 090.</div>
<div><b>194:09:41 CC: </b>325, 090, and 000.</div>
<div><b>194:09:47 Shepard: </b>Okay. We're on the way.</div>
<div><b>194:11:27 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>194:11:28 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>194:11:32 Roosa: </b>Okay. Bruce. We've got this bag that the - hatch -the hatch - window bracket for the camera, you know, they used on the zero phase, and we had as a stand by - 70-millimeter-camera hatch window adapter bag, and It's big enough to go over the - the probe head. We just sweat it a little bit.</div>
<div><b>194:12:01 CC: </b>Beautiful, Stu. If you can get that over and tape her down so that you have a water - salt water spray protection on the probe head, that's all we need. Over.</div>
<div><b>194:12:12 Roosa: </b>Okay. We'll do that.</div>
<div><b>194:15:50 CC: </b>14, this Houston. How are you reading me, now? Over.</div>
<div><b>194:22:37 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. How do you read? Over.</div>
<div><b>194:23:12 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. How do you read? Over.</div>
<div><b>194:25:29 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. How do you read? Over.</div>
<div><b>194:26:27 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. Request OMNI Charlie. Request OMNI Charlie in the blind. Over.</div>
<div><b>194:26:44 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Request OMNI Charlie, OMNI Charlie in the blind. Over.</div>
<div><b>194:27:28 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. Requesting OMNI Charlie in the blind. Over.</div>
<div><b>194:28:12 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. How do you read? Over,</div>
<div><b>194:28:19 Shepard: </b>We read you loud and clear, Houston.</div>
<div><b>194:28:21 CC: </b>Roger, 14. We'd like to stow the probe temporarily in some convenient location and prepare for the press conference. I'll turn it over to Gordon, here.</div>
<div><b>194:28:34 Shepard: </b>I took your downlink down, Bruce. You should be getting us.</div>
<div><b>194:28:36 CC: </b>Roger. We've got a beautiful picture here.</div>
<div><b>194:28:41 Shepard: </b>We're ready to go any time.</div>
<div><b>194:28:48 CC: </b>Okay, Al. The questions that you'll be asked at this news conference have been submitted by newsmen here at the Manned Spacecraft Center who have been covering the flight.</div>
<div><b>194:28:58 Shepard: </b>Gordo?</div>
<div><b>194:29:00 CC: </b>Go ahead, Al.</div>
<div><b>194:29:02 Shepard: </b>Could you - could you hold on just a minute? We'll get in position to answer the questions.</div>
<div><b>194:29:06 CC: </b>All right, fine. Just let us - when - let us know when you're ready.</div>
<div><b>194:29:41 CC: </b>And, for your information, we're getting a very good picture - -</div>
<div><b>194:29:43 Shepard: </b>Are you getting a picture, now?</div>
<div><b>194:29:45 CC: </b>That's affirmative. Good picture. All three of you in there. The questions that you'll be asked at this news conference have been submitted here at the Manned Spacecraft Center by newsmen who have been covering the flight. Some of the questions they raised have been answered in your communications with Mission Control, but the public-at-large has not necessarily heard them. The questions are being read to you exactly as submitted by the newsmen and in an order specified by them. First of all, for Al and Ed. Cone Crater was your major objective on your second moonwalk. You almost made the rim. How close do you think you got, and do you believe you collected enough rocks and samples to accomplish the purpose of your mission?</div>
<div><b>194:30:34 Shepard: </b>I think so. Let me take the first part of it, with respect to how close we got. I think we were within perhaps 100 yards or less of the rim and certainly in a boulder field that was right there associated with the boulders in the rim.</div>
<div><b>194:30:55 Mitchell: </b>I agree with Al. I agree with Al. I think we were in 100 to 150 yards, and I think the majority of the type rocks that - ... find at the rim were in the boulder field that we were working; and although it was a disappointment, just as a matter of challenge, not to get up there, I think we accomplished the scientific objectives that we went for.</div>
<div><b>194:31:24 CC: </b>It is hard for us to get a feel for what it was like in the large boulder field. Was it a forest of big rocks higher than you? Could you see any distance? Over.</div>
<div><b>194:31:38 Shepard: </b>Well, the - the rocks that we were in - ranging in different sizes. They ranged up to 10 or 12 feet in height above us; so, at times, we were behind rocks that were taller than we were. As far as the mobility?s concerned, Ed, do you want talk about that?</div>
<div><b>194:31:57 Mitchell: </b>Yes. We didn't have a great deal of trouble moving around the rocks. We didn't even have trouble moving the MET around the rocks, except we did have to dodge them and, of course, had to be a bit more careful with the MET that - walking without it. Our major problem, however, was the undulating sur -terrain where you sLMPly couldn't see more than 100 to 150 yards away from you and see landmarks. Consequently, you were never quite sure what landmark would appear when you topped the next ridge, and we were very surprised when we topped the ridge - approached the ridge which we thought to be the rim of Cone Crater to find there was another one beyond it, and that was the beginning of the real problem.</div>
<div><b>194:32:48 CC: </b>The next question is: tell us about your problems of fatigue, orientation, and visibility; and apply them, if you will, to the longer 7-hour moonwalks planned for Apollo 15.</div>
<div><b>194:33:06 Shepard: </b>Well, I guess we didn't realize that we had problems of fatigue and visibility. As far as we were concerned, our only problem was the amount of time allotted for the excursion. We - I don't exactly know what our heart rates were. Obviously, they were higher than the normal sitting rate, but we still were not operating at maximum capacity of our backpacks for cooling, nor were we operating for extended periods of time at high heart rate. To us, it was Just a matter of working against the clock. I think that we had the capability to go longer from the standpoint of fatigue. I don't believe that we were disoriented or lost at any -any time at all, either.</div>
<div><b>194:33:51 Mitchell: </b>Yes, I agree with Al. If my previous answer misled you, it was only a matter of context, because, given a few minutes to look around, we figured out where we were, but trying to do it rapidly made it difficult; and, as Al says, time was our major factor. Given another 30 or 40 minutes, I think we could have reached the top of Cone Crater, covered all of our objectives, and - get back in good fashion.</div>
<div><b>194:34:22 Shepard: </b>Well, let me add one thing here. I think if we had wanted to reach the top of the crater, and did nothing else, that we could have done that within the time period allotted. But I think that this method in which we reverted to, that of collecting rocks from a point not quite near the top of the crater, provided a lot more geologically, and gave us a better cross section of the rocks in the area, and, therefore, a better chance of getting rocks ejected from Imbrium than had we gone to the crater and back and not collected as many rocks.</div>
<div><b>194:35:00 CC: </b>The next question is for Stu Roosa. Stu, what did you see of the lunar module from orbit?</div>
<div><b>194:35:10 Roosa: </b>Okay. The first pass that I made on the landmark tracking, I picked the LM up with no problem. It just showed up as a - as a white - a white spot, obviously something foreign to the lunar surface, reflecting light, but the ringer was the long shadow put out. The first day that I tracked it, why, the Sun angle was still pretty low; and you could, see the shadow coming out; and the shadow and the - and the reflection cinched it as the LM. Now, you couldn't see a shape of the LM, as such, but - was no doubt the LM was there. And on the next day, as I was doing landmark tracking, it was not on - in the schedule to track the LM again; however, I had a. landmark just prior to the Fra Mauro region and one after it. And I was in forma -the right attitude for landmark tracking; so, I looked for the LM again - found it this time without any trouble. The shadow had diminished to -to almost nothing, or it was very small; but, here again, then, I could see the glint coming off the ALSEP. At this time, the ALSEP had been deployed; so, I could see the glint coming off it. And I checked with Ron Evans later on the - and told him what I thought it was, and he agreed that that was the ALSEP location.</div>
<div><b>194:36:39 CC: </b>The next question is also for you, Stu. A top priority for you is taking detailed pictures of the Descartes Crater as a possible landing site for a later mission. Since your big camera was broken, do you think you got enough high-resolution photos?</div>
<div><b>194:36:58 Roosa: </b>Well, I guess - well, I'd say yes. We made three passes and - with the 500-millimeter, using what we call the C0AS maneuver, or you - you pitch and keep the camera on the Descartes landing site, and this way you get a real good stereo. And, I guess, we'll have to develop the pictures and see - see how they are. But I'd - I'd say the answer to that's probably yes, but I - I really can't answer it completely at this time.</div>
<div><b>194:37:33 CC: </b>With your docking problem, and battery problem, abort switch problem, and a problem with the landing radar, how concerned were you about not making a successful landing or a safe return?</div>
<div><b>194:37:49 Mitchell: </b>This is Ed, I never doubted it for a minute. We were going to make it,</div>
<div><b>194:37:55 Shepard: </b>Well, I guess we're always concerned about the operation of the equipment. That's what we're up here for is to - to assure that it operates - to the best of our ability, as well as it's designed to function all the time. We're always concerned about that, and we still are. We still have a little bit of this voyage left to go, and we're still concerned about a safe return. I think that anyone that's involved in this kind of a business of research flying has to be concerned until the flight is totally over.</div>
<div><b>194:38:36 Mitchell: </b>I - I'd like to make one other comment, too, about -the question about the - Stu's pictures of Descartes. The photographic technique which he used is essentially the same as Apollo 12 used, which took the pictures of the area in which it landed. We feel that was successful.</div>
<div><b>194:38:57 CC: </b>The next question. Other crews had trouble with dust. How did dust affect you on landing, on the surface, and on the way back?</div>
<div><b>194:39:08 Shepard: </b>Well, let me take the landing part, and I'll give Ed the surface part, and let Stu handle the way-back part. As far as the landing was concerned, there was - there was less dust than I figured; and I think that was generally borne out as we progressed through our EVA; but the dust started forming, I think, approximately 100 feet above the surface, maybe 150. It was a thin layer, as we've seen before but less dense than what I expected. And it did not interfere with my vision or capability to land at all. Now, do you want to talk about how it was on the surface?</div>
<div><b>194:39:44 Mitchell: </b>I think it was substantially as previous crews have reported it, as far as working on the surface is concerned. It's a nuisance. The material is soft. It clings very readily to equipment, to your suits, and it's - it's a nuisance. But surprisingly, we didn't find that we had too much of it on the LM with us in the evening - rather the first night, nor did we feel we carried too much of it back in with us after the second EVA, except for the fact that it was - had LMPreg - LMPregnated the top of the suits and was on most other pieces of cloth. However, it came off of the metal very readily, and that didn't cause any problem. I think it was more of a nuisance than anything else.</div>
<div><b>194:40:37 Roosa: </b>Okay. As far as - after the docking and on the way back, the dust problem's really been nonexistent. They - Of course, A1 and Ed took their suits off in the - in the LM; and then, we have a vacuum cleaner in the command module and which I passed over; and they vacuumed the suits. And I passed over several bags in which they put all of the equipment that they brought from the lunar surface into these bags. They have zippers on them and so forth that are to keep the fine dust in. So, I took each one of their suits and put it in a special suit bag that we have in here and another bag that they came back across; and by holding a little positive pressure in the command module, we - we've had very - very little dust, and absolutely no -no problem at all.</div>
<div><b>194:41:30 CC: </b>Now we?d like to - -</div>
<div><b>194:41:31 Shepard: </b>I think you might - I might just add that we certainly have benefited - from the - from the lessons of earlier flights in this respect. I think the problem, particularly on Apollo 12, showed us how to handle the dust problem, and I think that we have most of the answers now solved.</div>
<div><b>194:41:50 CC: </b>Now, we?d like you tell us about the rocks you're bringing back. How big are they? What is their texture, color, and did they crumble? And compare them with the rocks on Apollos 11 and 12.</div>
<div><b>194:42:12 Shepard: </b>Well, I tell you, we've been so busy, we really haven't looked at the rocks. Stu's going to see if he can't find one for us now. But while he's digging, to comment on that particular question; of course, we don't have the equipment here to analyze these rocks from the standpoint of mineral content and how they compare with the various mineral percentages with those that have been brought back, but with respect to size - We didn't have a dust problem until just now (laughter). With respect to size, I think the largest we brought back is about a foot in its diameter, and the large rocks we've brought back were not crumbly. Some of the rock specimens, the smaller hand samples which we collected, were, in fact, crumbly; but the large rocks we brought back, I think we have four or five relatively large rocks. And these are - are not of the crumbling type. I think we just - because of the dusty (laughter) problem which now has been created. I think we'll have to hold on showing you a rock until we get back.</div>
<div><b>194:43:27 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>194:43:28 Roosa: </b>I don't - I don't want to get a rock out.</div>
<div><b>194:43:35 CC: </b>The next question is for A1 Shepard. Was the terrain in the landing area different from what you expected? And describe your reaction to landing on a slope.</div>
<div><b>194:43:45 Shepard: </b>No. With respect to the general terrain, it was exactly as we had expected. As a matter of fact, as soon as the vehicle pitched over in the final stages of the landing approach, I was immediately able to recognize where we were and could control the spacecraft accordingly. We were essentially right on target, and we landed essentially right on target. I had originally planned to land a little bit to the south of the designated spot, perhaps within a couple hundred yards, because I thought it was smoother there. It turned out that there really was no smooth place within the general area of the landing site. As far as the slope was concerned, there was something like a 7-degree slope, and it didn't give us any problem at all. The LM landed very softly, gently. No tendency for it to topple over, and it stayed there steady as a rock for the duration of the stay.</div>
<div><b>194:44:45 CC: </b>This next question is for each of you. As space pilots, what is your dominant professional LMPression of the flight?</div>
<div><b>194:45:07 Roosa: </b>Well, I guess any - any comment like that - the answer that I'd give - would be that to me it's gone - it's been very gratifying. I think it's been a challenge, and I think each one of us has certainly had the chance to use his abilities as a - as a research pilot and scientist. And I -I think it's gone real well up to this point. And before we elaborate too much on - on a postmission conference, I'd rather wait until after the entry.</div>
<div><b>194:45:51 DIP: </b>I think Stu's put it very well. The small things we've had to encounter that were unexpected have been handled very well by the entire team. I think everyone on the team functioned very well, certainly from our point of view. And all the major objectives that we went after were accomplished - a certain -at least, well backed up whether we accomplished them per se or not. In my opinion, the mission was, to this point, quite a success. And I expect the reentry to be quite a success.</div>
<div><b>194:46:30 Shepard: </b>I would only add to those comments that - that we're basically sensible people, that we?re involved in a program of developing and promoting technology. Apollo 12 is only one - one step in the space technology. I feel that Apollo 12 -Apollo 14, I should say - has been a - a resounding success; and I don't really think that we've been able to assess, at this stage, what the contributions will be; but I can intuitively tell from what we've done, what we've seen on the surface, that we're bringing back a wealth of information photographically and geologically, that we've left stations and other stations on the Moon sending back information for scientific purposes. And I think that, generally speaking, it was a smashing success.</div>
<div><b>194:47:25 CC: </b>Again, for each of you. What event in the flight touched you most emotionally?</div>
<div><b>194:47:37 Shepard: </b>Well., I think the big emotion for me is yet to come, and that's getting both feet on the carrier.</div>
<div><b>194:47:45 Roosa: </b>Okay. I'd say up to - There - there's been a lot of rather tremendous sights on the mission so far, and entry will be another one; but I guess, the -the first look at the Moon after you - after you burn L0I and in the darkness and you come around, pitch to an attitude where you can see - see the Moon and It's there below you at about 60 miles, but it looks like about 200 feet. And your first LMPression of the body is a rather tremendous thing.</div>
<div><b>194:48:27 Mitchell: </b>I think Stu's choice is my number 2, and my number-1 LMPact is when we pitched over and there was Cone Crater right out the window. It was very LMPressive.</div>
<div><b>194:48:42 CC: </b>You have not talked to your wives and families since you left Cape Kennedy. Is there anything that you would like to say to them now? We will make sure they hear about it.</div>
<div><b>194:48:55 Shepard: </b>Well, thank you. I'm sure you all have done a wonderful job of keeping them posted, particularly with the communications link and everything; and I guess, perhaps, they're probably as well informed of the flight as we are ourselves; but, in case they don?t know, we're all very well, very happy, and say hello; and we'll look forward to seeing them in a few days. Ed?</div>
<div><b>194:49:19 Mitchell: </b>I have nothing to add to that at all.</div>
<div><b>194:49:23 Roosa: </b>No, No. We'll be in touch.</div>
<div><b>194:49:29 CC: </b>The next question is for Al. Would you give us your personal feelings about the differences between the rides on Freedom 7 a decade ago, and Apollo 14?</div>
<div><b>194:49:46 Shepard: </b>One big step. It's very difficult to - Of course, as the question LMPlies, discuss the technical differences between the - the two flights. And from the standpoint of personal differences, I think that for those days, that the Mercury-Redstone flight was just as much of an individual challenge as has been Apollo 14. I think, of course, the machinery are different, but the -the men with whom we worked, the individuals that helped us along, are pretty much the same; and, therefore, the emotions are pretty much the same. Both were a great thrill for me; there's no question about that.</div>
<div><b>194:50:39 CC: </b>The final question is also for Al. You became the first lunar golfer with your little six iron. How many golf balls did you hit, how far did they go, and did you make the green?</div>
<div><b>194:51:14 Mitchell: </b>Let me add, there wasn't any green in sight.</div>
<div><b>194:51:17 Shepard: </b>There were no green rocks; there where no green rocks.</div>
<div><b>194:51:23 CC: </b>Thank you very much. We've certainly enjoyed every minute of - of your commentary, and this concludes the list of questions that we have for you. Thank you, again.</div>
<div><b>194:51:33 Shepard: </b>Thank you, and we'll look forward to seeing you shortly.</div>
<div><b>194:51:39 Mitchell: </b>That sounds good.</div>
<div><b>194:52:48 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>194:52:51 Shepard: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>194:52:53 CC: </b>This attitude will be a good one to hold through the P52. Over.</div>
<div><b>194:53:02 Shepard: </b>Okay. Is it also a good attitude for probe stowage?</div>
<div><b>194:53:07 CC: </b>It's also a good attitude for probe stowage.</div>
<div><b>194:53:22 Shepard: </b>How was the quality of the picture on that last television transmission, Houston?</div>
<div><b>194:53:28 CC: </b>It was a very good picture; in fact, our estimate is that it was as good as it's been at any time during the flight.</div>
<div><b>194:53:40 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>194:55:30 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. Whenever you are ready, we'll press on with the probe stowage; and at this time, you can go ahead and take the - the TV monitor, the monitor cables, power cable, cable bracket, and stow all that in the Bravo-1, wrapping the monitor in a CWG. Over.</div>
<div><b>194:55:53 Roosa: </b>Okay, in work.</div>
<div><b>195:02:14 Roosa: </b>Okay, Houston. We're - we have the monitor and the cable on bracket B-l, and we're just touching up the cover for the probe head right now. Be back with you shortly.</div>
<div><b>195:02:28 CC: </b>Roger. We're standing by.</div>
<div><b>195:04:21 Shepard: </b>Okay, Houston. I think we have the probe head pretty well protected with that Beta bag we discussed and we're ready to press on.</div>
<div><b>195:04:28 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. The next step is an initial fitting of the probe into its stowage location. We'd like you to place the probe between the A-6 and A-10 lockers with a pitch arm down towards the aft bulkhead between A-6 and A-10 and the apex -that is, the probe head towards A-12. The base end of the probe with the Flight Data File Book on it should be touching the right-hand equipment bay panel. The probe should be oriented so that the yellow support arm touches the top or plus-X side of the A-6 locker. And it should be resting on five points, which I'll read off to you after you get it in position. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:06:03 Roosa: </b>Hey, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>195:06:04 CC: </b>Go ahead, Stu. You're very weak though - -</div>
<div><b>195:06:06 Roosa: </b>Hey, Bruce. You said the hatch - What - what's the orientation of the hatch installation strut?</div>
<div><b>195:06:13 CC: </b>Okay, the yellow one is on the top side, or the plus-X side of the A-6 locker and then there?s a pitch arm pointed down toward the aft bulkhead between A-6 and A-10. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:07:08 Shepard: </b>Okay, tell us how it should look now.</div>
<div><b>195:07:11 CC: </b>Okay. It should be resting on five points. The probe head should be on the A-10 locker, or somewhere above it.</div>
<div><b>195:07:27 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>195:07:29 CC: </b>There should be a support arm touching the plus-7 side of the A-10 locker.</div>
<div><b>195:07:48 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>195:07:49 CC: </b>The yellow support arm should be touching the top, or plus-X side of A-6.</div>
<div><b>195:07:58 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>195:08:00 CC: </b>The base of the probe, with the Flight Data File Lunar Landmark Book, should be firmly up against the right-hand equipment bay wall. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:08:12 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>195:08:13 CC: </b>And there should be a shock strut touching the plus-Y edge of the A-10 locker. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:08:31 Roosa: </b>Okay. Bruce, it doesn't look like we can have the installation strut touching A-6, and the shock strut touching the top of A-10 at the same time.</div>
<div><b>195:08:44 CC: </b>Okay, in the next step, we're going to shim at five locations, and one of the places where we're going to shim is underneath the yellow support arm on top of A-6; so if it's very close to the top, that'll be satisfactory.</div>
<div><b>195:10:04 Shepard: </b>Okay, I think we see your point. This means that you do - actually do not have a shock strut touching the - the aft bulkhead.</div>
<div><b>195:10:13 CC: </b>That?s affirmative. The shock strut is not touching aft bulkhead.</div>
<div><b>195:10:19 Shepard: </b>Or at least the cable run, which is on top of the aft bulkhead at this point.</div>
<div><b>195:10:26 CC: </b>Roger. It - I think it's the pitch arm you're referring to, and that's correct. It is not coming into contact with the aft bulkhead yet. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:10:39 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>195:10:54 CC: </b>A1, what we should have - -</div>
<div><b>195:10:56 Shepard: </b>Okay. We're with you.</div>
<div><b>195:10:57 CC: </b>- - We should have the shock strut which is attached to the support arm for installation of the probe assembly in the hatch resting on the plus-Y edge of the A-10 locker. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:12:03 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. The way we've got this probe now, it's making contact with the probe head on A-10 and it's up against the - the side bulkhead. And then this support strut that goes down to the support arm is - on - is on - is touching A-10. And those are the only three points right now that we have any contact. Now, it - Does that sound like we?re in the right spot?</div>
<div><b>195:12:34 CC: </b>Roger; it does. What you're calling the support arm is what we've been calling the shock strut. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:12:43 Roosa: </b>Okay. To make sure we have our semantics right, we?ve got support arms and pitch beams. Is that right?</div>
<div><b>195:12:59 CC: </b>Roger. We?ve got support arms and pitch arms -or pitch beams and the support arms are connected to the little shock struts. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:13:12 Roosa: </b>Okay. So I think we're now in - in the position you're describing, and we have a space between the yellow installation strut and A-6, and a space between the pitch arm and the top of A-10.</div>
<div><b>195:13:30 Shepard: </b>And a space between the pitch arm - -</div>
<div><b>195:13:31 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>195:13:33 Shepard: </b>- - we're running the other ...</div>
<div><b>195:13:36 CC: </b>Okay, now then. We want you to locate, on the command module, the following locations where we intend to place shims. First is on the aft bulkhead, underneath the pitch arm that is thrusting down towards the aft bulkhead, but is not in contact with it. At this location, we intend to put in - a bumper. It will not be a solid shim, but it will serve to spread out any force should the pitch arm come into contact with the aft bulkhead. Over. We'll put one - one Flight Data File Book that you do not require for entry down there and, when we refer to Flight Data File Books here, you can of course, use LM books as well as command module books. It's your preference. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:14:31 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>195:14:33 CC: </b>Okay, The next location is on the right hand, or plus-Y side of A-10, where the support arm comes close to touching on the side of the A-10 locker or where it may actually touch, depending on the precise location that you've got there. We'd like a thin Flight Data File Book in that place.</div>
<div><b>195:14:58 Shepard: </b>Yes, we've got it figured - It'll be about 2 inches of padding there, but we see the point you're talking about.</div>
<div><b>195:15:07 CC: </b>We're talking about the face of the A-10 locker that's over toward the right-hand equipment bay paneling. Are you talking about the same place?</div>
<div><b>195:15:16 Shepard: </b>Right. Plus-Y side.</div>
<div><b>195:15:18 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>195:15:38 CC: </b>Okay, it sounds like you've got the right location there. Another place is where the probe head touches A-10 and where the pitch arm comes over A-10. We'd like to shim up on both those locations.</div>
<div><b>195:15:58 Shepard: </b>Okay. Then we've got one, two, three, four, five locations.</div>
<div><b>195:16:04 CC: </b>Okay. And the fifth location, of course, is where the yellow support arm passes over the top of A-6. In all of those locations, except the first one -that is the aft bulkhead underneath the pitch arm -we'd like to shim with unused publications, such that the probe is firmly in contact with the underlying structure. And you may recall earlier this afternoon that I referred to use of the sleeping bag and window shade cover on the aft bulkhead - we've modified that stowage and deleted the requirement for the window shade; so, you can use them for a good night's sleep. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:16:42 Shepard: </b>Very good. We understand.</div>
<div><b>195:16:45 CC: </b>Okay, at this juncture - if you have the contents of the shims in mind and the locations in place, go ahead and remove the probe and tape the shims in place with the tape you have from R-6. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:17:08 CC: </b>And, as you go along, we'd be interested in knowing which books go in which location. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:17:21 Shepard: </b>Okay (laughter). . Would you also like to know which page they're opened?</div>
<div><b>195:17:27 .CC: </b>(Laughter) Negative. That doesn't matter. And you can delete our request for books.</div>
<div><b>195:17:37 Shepard: </b>Okay. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>195:18:51 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>195:18:53 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>195:18:56 Roosa: </b>, Okay, Bruce. I just want to make sure that we've got it clarified. Tell me again what - you mean when you say the probe is fully folded.</div>
<div><b>195:19:11 CC: </b>Stand by a minute, Stu. We're coming up on a site handover. I'll give you a call as soon as we reacquire. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:19:18 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>195:20:15 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>195:20:26 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:20:30 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>195:20:31 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. If you'll look at the yellow installation arm. About halfway down its length - If the probe is fully collapsed, then this arm should be bearing against a Teflon block that's part of the ratchet handle housing there. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:20:54 Roosa: </b>Okay. The Teflon block is not bearing against -that. It's against the ratchet pawl - it's I believe - is what it's going to come in contact with. So how do I get it there?</div>
<div><b>195:21:08 CC: </b>Okay, you?ve got about - probably one or two clicks left on the - the ratchet - should be able to extend it there by the normal procedures. I'll give you a talkthrough, if you like.</div>
<div><b>195:21:20 Roosa: </b>Okay, stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>195:23:25 CC: </b>Hey, Stu; aren't you glad you got a couple knot-tying swabbies on board for this job?</div>
<div><b>195:23:32 Roosa: </b>Yes. How about that.</div>
<div><b>195:27:33 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. How are you coming? Over.</div>
<div><b>195:27:39 Shepard: </b>Well, we're getting books now, and we have the probe fully folded, and we?re in the shimming process.</div>
<div><b>195:27:48 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>195:33:16 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Stand by for a mark on 100,000 miles from the Earth. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:33:26 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>195:33:27 CC: </b>Stand by.</div>
<div><b>195:33:29 CC: </b>MARK; 100,000 miles.</div>
<div><b>195:33:33 Shepard: </b>Beautiful, beautiful. Getting closer all the time.</div>
<div><b>195:36:11 Shepard: </b>Okay. We're all ship and ready for the next step, Houston.</div>
<div><b>195:36:16 CC: </b>Okay. The next step is to put the probe back in place and verify that it contacts the shims as required and the other hard points. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:36:28 Shepard: </b>Okay. We verify that.</div>
<div><b>195:36:30 CC: </b>Okay. Using the double rope from the A-6 anchor, tie that to the apex of the pitch arm which points in the plus-X direction, making the rope as tight as possible.</div>
<div><b>195:38:12 Shepard: </b>Okay. That's complete.</div>
<div><b>195:38:15 CC: </b>Okay, with the three-rope combination from the other footpad on A-6, we want you to tie that also to the apex of the plus-X pitch arm, cinching it up tightly and try not to use too much line in this knot because it's going to go on from there down to the tiedown point on the side of A-10 - directly beneath it. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:38:45 CC: </b>But don't tie it to A-10 - -</div>
<div><b>195:38:47 Shepard: </b>Okay. I think - just a loop through the fitting up against that - the apex of that pitch arm should do it, huh?</div>
<div><b>195:38:54 CC: </b>Okay, a loop with maybe a half hitch in it or something like that.</div>
<div><b>195:39:03 Shepard: </b>All righty.</div>
<div><b>195:39:05 CC: </b>And if Ed or Stu could get out tools Foxtrot, Whiskey, and one, we'll be ready for the next step, when you're ready.</div>
<div><b>195:39:46 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. Now we're running that rope across through the hook on the outboard side of A-8. Is that - or is - is it the one on A-10?</div>
<div><b>195:39:58 CC: </b>No. It's going to be going to A-10, but before you tie it down there, we?d like to disassemble one of the support arms shock strut assemblies at one point. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:40:10 Roosa: </b>Qkay. Well, we're standing by to tie down as soon as we get the toolkit out.</div>
<div><b>195:40:15 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>195:40:45 Mitchell: </b>Houston, what tools do you think we need, now?</div>
<div><b>195:40:48 CC: </b>Foxtrot, the crescent wrench; Whiskey, the ratchet driver; and one, which is a socket. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:41:03 CC: </b>Now, what we're planning on doing is - on the support arm that points in the - diagonally in the plus-X, minus-Z direction - we want you to remove the bolt at the joint between the support arm and the shock strut with F, W, and one - and then you're going to put the bolt back in the hole of the support arm - We're reinstalling that finger tight, on that. . Over.</div>
<div><b>195:41:32 Roosa: </b>Okay. Well, that's in work.</div>
<div><b>195:41:35 CC: </b>And, of course, the reason for doing this is to get it out of the couch stroke envelope.</div>
<div><b>195:41:42 Roosa: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>195:43:39 Shepard: </b>Did you say you want the bolt and the nut back in the shock strut?</div>
<div><b>195:43:43 .CC: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>195:43:46 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>195:43:57 CC: </b>Al, this is Houston. Make that in the support arm part. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:44:06 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>195:44:25 Shepard: </b>Okay, that is done.</div>
<div><b>195:44:28 CC: </b>Okay. Now using some of the LM webbing - we'd like you to tie the support arm and shock strut against the body of the probe to keep it from flapping. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:44:42 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>195:47:23 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. We?d like to get OXYGEN tank 3 HEATERs to OFF now. 1 and 2, AUTO. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:47:33 Shepard: </b>3, OFF; 1 and 2, AUTO. Okay.</div>
<div><b>195:47:36 CC: </b>Roger. That's 1 and 2, AUTO. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:48:26 CC: </b>14, Houston. Confirm OXYGEN tank 3 HEATERs, OFF. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:48:35 Shepard: </b>Okay. We've got OXYGEN tank HEATER number 3, OFF. 0-F-F. We have oxygen tank HEATERs number 1 and number 2, AUTO. A-U-T-O.</div>
<div><b>195:48:50 CC: </b>(Laughter) Roger, 14.</div>
<div><b>195:50:10 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Houston, That step is complete now. The -the webbing has been used to tie down the support arm.</div>
<div><b>195:50:20 CC: </b>Roger. Understand you've got the support arm and the shock strut tied down against the probe and the - the bolts back in the hole - the support arm, and are ready to press on with the lashing down. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:50:32 Mitchell: </b>Roger. I suppose the next step is to tighten up the line going down to the A-10 island.</div>
<div><b>195:50:38 .CC: </b>Okay. That - triple-rope combination that came from A-6 and was looped or tied around the apex of the plus-X pointing pitch arm - then goes down to the plux-Z, plus-Y D-ring on the A-10 locker -tied there, and then up to the apex of the pitch arm which points in the minus-Z direction and from there it's going to go down to the minus-Z, plus-Y D-ring on A-10. We can take that a step at a time if you like.</div>
<div><b>195:51:23 Mitchell: </b>Okay. This is the first rope you're talking about now, that comes up to the apex of the pitch arm and then goes down through the tiedown and A-10.</div>
<div><b>195:51:33 CC: </b>Right.</div>
<div><b>195:51:34 Mitchell: </b>And then where?</div>
<div><b>195:51:35 CC: </b>And then it comes up to the apex of the pitch arm which points in the minus-Z direction and then back down to the other tie ring on the side of A-10. You?re going to wind up with a - a rope that would look sort of M-shaped when viewed from the side. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:57:28 Shepard: </b>Okay. Rope number 1 is tied in M as in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</div>
<div><b>195:57:36 CC: </b>Roger, Al. And that rope number 1 is the triplerope combination. Is that correct?</div>
<div><b>195:57:45 Shepard: </b>That's the first of the - of the tripartite agreements.</div>
<div><b>195:57:49 CC: </b>Say again, please?</div>
<div><b>195:57:51 Shepard: </b>That's the first party of the tripartite agreements.</div>
<div><b>195:57:56 CC: </b>Okay. Then the other two parties have to follow suit, also. Over.</div>
<div><b>195:58:03 Shepard: </b>Okay. All three follows same path, huh?</div>
<div><b>195:58:05 CC: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>196:00:54 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. If one of you is free - we'd like to start the VERB 49 maneuver to the optics calibration attitude, now. Over.</div>
<div><b>196:01:03 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Houston. We'll get it going.</div>
<div><b>196:05:11 Shepard: </b>Okay, Houston. That?s been completed. We have a triple pass now as described - in the shape of an M.</div>
<div><b>196:05:18 CC: </b>Okay. Now, taking the fifth and last rope, we'd like you to double it, and tie one end of it to the minus-Z, plus-Y footpad of the A-5 locker. You?ll then loop it around the probe head and tie it to the minus-Y, plus-Z D-ring on A-10. Over.</div>
<div><b>196:05:40 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>196:06:07 Shepard: </b>Do you want this double or singled?</div>
<div><b>196:06:09 CC: </b>It'll be a double strand. You can just double the rope up, and you can tie the bight of it around the minus-Z, plus-Y foot pad of A-5 and go on with the double strand from there.</div>
<div><b>196:06:22 Shepard: </b>Okay. Very good.</div>
<div><b>196:11:41 Shepard: </b>Okay, Houston. That step's complete.</div>
<div><b>196:11:46 CC: </b>Okay, 14. That brings us to the end of the famous Apollo 14 probe stowage for reentry procedure. Who did the least work on stowing this? We'd like a quality control inspection, please. Over.</div>
<div><b>196:12:02 Shepard: </b>Everybody did 33 and one-third percent. You'll have to call 21 Nancy - in on this.</div>
<div><b>196:12:08 CC: </b>Roger. 21 Nancy. And the only outstanding items from this afternoon's efforts then are the final tying down of the 30-pound decontamination bag with contents on top of A-13, the 20-pound.bag on top of A?8 and the CMP's PGA, with helmet on top of the 20-pound bag and then verifying 4 inches of clearance under the couch. We'll check with you on that tomorrow.</div>
<div><b>196:12:40 Shepard: </b>Okay. We?ve got that.</div>
<div><b>196:12:43 CC: </b>Okay. That takes care of tying it down and I'm going to hand over to Gordon here and you can press on with the optics calibration and the - I guess you've got to get the P - the optics calibration and flight plan as normal. Over.</div>
<div><b>196:12:58 Shepard: </b>Okay. Thank you very much. We're - That's a good stowage procedure. It's tight as can be here. We ought not to have any problems at all.</div>
<div><b>196:13:13 CC: </b>And you're in a suitable attitude to run the P52, also, which you probably ought to do prior to starting in the P23. Over.</div>
<div><b>196:13:23 Roosa: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>196:17:50 CC: </b>Al, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>196:17:55 Shepard: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>196:17:57 CC: </b>Al, if you have time - it'll take about a couple of minutes here, but I have a fairly lengthy question here regarding the circuit breaker configuration yesterday during the ET0. Is this a good time to do it?</div>
<div><b>196:18:17 Shepard: </b>Okay, I'm not sure we can remember - but give us the question and we'll take a whack at it.</div>
<div><b>196:18:24 CC: </b>Okay. At the start of the high flow portion of the DT0, Bruce was on and he read up to you to pull the 0^ TANK'S 3 50-WATT circuit breaker - HEATER circuit breaker. And you Rogered and we checked the transcript - but this call was made about an hour prior to actually starting the high flow - and then later when - after I came on during the low flow part of the DIO - I called -you went on a TANK 3 HEATER cycle - the heater TEMP hit the upper limit and we asked for the heater switch OFF. We asked you to check and you confirmed that the TANK 3 50-WATT breaker was in and that you must have missed it earlier. Now, the problem is - that the engineers who are analyzing the data from the - whole DTO are not sure where the circuit breaker was during the entire period of the DTO, and it really doesn't matter whether the circuit breaker was in or out, as long as we know where it was during the test. Can you tell us the history of the position of the breaker during the high flow portion? Was it ever pulled prior to my call on the temperature going out of limits - and if so - when was it pulled, and then when did it get put back in? Over.</div>
<div><b>196:19:44 Mitchell: </b>Okay. This is Ed. I probably have the story better than anybody, and I'm not sure I have it. It was pulled when it was called to be pulled and A1 and I both remember that - and it was noticed that it was back in - shortly before you called us and asked about it. I was over - Oh, when I did the 0^ - when I closed the 0^ ISOL AUX BATTERY switch - I saw at that time that the 50 1 HEATER was in and I vaguely remembered it should be out and yet it was in and that's when it was noticed. When it went in - I don't know, but it was definitely pulled on call and I was surprised to find it back in when I reconfigured after the test - and you called us shortly after that.</div>
<div><b>196:20:41 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. If you?d stand by a minute, I'll see if they have any further questions to - to clarify.</div>
<div><b>196:21:32 CC: </b>Ed, if we really have no further specific questions - just - unless you could maybe make a best guess as to whether that breaker was in or out during the high flow portion of the DTO.</div>
<div><b>196:21:48 Mitchell: </b>Well, it - We started the high flow portion shortly after the time it was pulled, did we not?</div>
<div><b>196:21:56 CC: </b>I think - I checked on that, and they say it was about an hour, actually, of time gap in there.</div>
<div><b>196:22:08 Mitchell: </b>All right. Just a minute. We're talking here.</div>
<div><b>196:22:36 Mitchell: </b>Let us - take a look at the flight plan here and see if I can refresh my memory a little bit.</div>
<div><b>196:22:42 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. Don't expend an excessive amount of time on it, but if you think you can remember anything more about it, we'd appreciate it.</div>
<div><b>196:28:21 Mitchell: </b>Houston, Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>196:28:25 CC: </b>Go ahead, Ed.</div>
<div><b>196:28:27 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Gordon. In reviewing the - all the events that seemed to have taken place as per flight plan about that time, it was opened as the first item at 167 hours - I believe. We had to boost up the three items ... of the page. And, as far as I can tell no one was in that particular area - or had any work in that area - to tell when we terminated the test an hour or so later. And my best guess is that it was probably closed inadvertently by myself or by one of the other two guys - probably by myself - about the time that we were setting the circuit breakers for the end of the test. I noticed it at that point, but I don't actually know when it was closed.</div>
<div><b>196:29:27 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. I think that's - that?s good for our purposes. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>196:29:37 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>196:30:07 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>196:30:09 CC: </b>Go ahead, Ed.</div>
<div><b>196:30:12 Mitchell: </b>Now, that we're talking about it - it is suppose to be open now, is it not?</div>
<div><b>196:30:16 CC: </b>That's affirmative. And your previous estimate of - of the time line there on the circuit breaker</div>
<div><b>196:30:35 Mitchell: </b>tags up real well with the data. The - the engineers are pretty sure that that1s exactly what happened. Okay. .</div>
<div><b>196:30:40 CC: </b>If you have your flight plan still in hand, I got a short update for page 270.</div>
<div><b>196:30:46 Shepard: </b>Stand by.</div>
<div><b>196:31:09 Shepard ?: </b>Okay. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>196:31:11 CC: </b>Okay. On the sixth or seventh line down from the top where it gives the dark-side photo attitude of 122, 270, and 0, change 122 to 125. And the high gain angles that follow are still okay. Over.</div>
<div><b>196:31:28 Shepard: </b>Okay. 125 and minus 59 and ... 90.</div>
<div><b>196:31:33 CC: </b>That's affirmative. And then when the rates -when you damp the rates there, as per PTC procedure, we'll give you a GO when the rates are good for taking the photos.</div>
<div><b>196:31:47 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>196:31:48 CC: </b>That's it. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>196:34:03 Shepard: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>196:34:08 CC: </b>14, Houston. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>196:34:11 Shepard: </b>Because of our bug with the - with the probe, it appears as though what we're going to do on this 23 is to skip the constraint stars, just mark on the first three, and then go directly from that into the Earth-darkside attitude. I still expect we may be 10 or 15 minutes late on that. Does that pose any problem to you all, if we do that way?</div>
<div><b>196:34:38 CC: </b>Stand by 1, Al.</div>
<div><b>196:34:46 CC: </b>That sounds like a good plan to us, Al. And there is no real-time criticality on the earthside dim-line photography. Over.</div>
<div><b>196:34:59 Shepard: </b>Okay. Good enough. We?ll do it that way, then.</div>
<div><b>196:35:03 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>196:40:22 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>196:40:26 Shepard: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>196:40:27 CC: </b>Ah--</div>
<div><b>196:40:28 Shepard: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>196:40:29 CC: </b>The analyst for the P23 would like to see you shoot star number 4 also, Just the one star of the three constraint stars. They're using that as a trend star, and this permits them to tie the data between the other P23s into this one a little better. There's no problem being late with the dark-side photography. Over.</div>
<div><b>196:41:04 Shepard: </b>Okay. Sounds good.</div>
<div><b>197:03:42 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>197:03:49 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>197:03:51 CC: </b>Ed, if you'd pass this along to Stu. We noticed earlier today that he incorporated into the state vector the sightings on the constraint stars on earlier batches. We'd like to ask that he not incorporate his fourth star tonight into the state vector. Over.</div>
<div><b>197:04:09 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>197:17:59 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>197:18:03 CC: </b>Okay, Stu. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>197:18:07 Roosa: </b>Okay, Gordon. These backup alinements over here at 198. As far as I know, there's no DT0 or anything else associated with those; they were just put in - Because I wanted to try those. Why don't you talk it over there and consider about deleting, those?</div>
<div><b>197:18:28 CC: </b>Okay. I'll check on that.</div>
<div><b>197:18:58 CC: </b>Stu, this is Houston. It's strictly your choice. Over.</div>
<div><b>197:19:03 Roosa: </b>Okay. I think I'll delete those this evening. It'll put us just about back on time for the - for the rest period.</div>
<div><b>197:19:14 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>197:23:25 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston. I have a short update to the dim-light information.</div>
<div><b>197:23:33 Shepard: </b>Roger. Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>197:36:18 CC: </b>Apollo 14,'Houston. The update that I have affects the info to be loaded in the P22 there. Over.</div>
<div><b>197:36:28 Roosa: </b>Okay, Gordon. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>197:36:30 CC: </b>Okay. Just under the landmark coordinates, change the longitude over 2 from minus IT-5 to minus 25.000. Over.</div>
<div><b>197:36:51 Roosa: </b>Okay. Longitude over 2 to a minus 25.000.</div>
<div><b>197:36:55 CC: </b>That1s affirmative.</div>
<div><b>197:38:19 CC: </b>Stu, this is Houston. G&C reports your rates look good to take those photos when you get to them.</div>
<div><b>197:38:28 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>197:42:11 CC: </b>Stu, Houston. A reminder to disable all the jets.</div>
<div><b>197:42:19 Roosa: </b>Roger, Gordon. You know, I was looking at this attitude. You know, we're right over - With a big trunnion - it looks like there?s a lot of glare. I suppose the sextant will be all right. It shoots by it, but I was wondering why the attitude was such where we had this large trunnion?</div>
<div><b>197:42:44 CC: </b>Stand by. I'll have to get an answer on that one.</div>
<div><b>197:42:49 Roosa: </b>I mean, I'll go ahead and shoot it, but it's so far over.that I can't really see any of the Earth crescent through the telescope.</div>
<div><b>197:42:58 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>197:43:01 CC: </b>Stu, in answer to your question - Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>197:43:26 CC: </b>Stu, in answer to your question, the attitude is designed to afford the maximum shading from the Sun on the optics as possible. And we'd like you - wonder if you have looked through the sextant to verify that it - that they are boresighted on the Earth's - Earth dark side. Over.</div>
<div><b>197:43:46 Roosa: </b>Well, yes. It is. We still got that same scattered light problem, which we discussed on the way out. But - it's - It's off the terminator, sure enough, so if everybody's agreeable, we'll shoot it here.</div>
<div><b>197:44:11 CC: </b>That's affirmative. They concur. They expected some scattered light and they'd like to go ahead and take the pictures as shown in the flight plan.</div>
<div><b>197:44:20 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>197:53:01 Shepard: </b>Houston, 14. We've completed darkside photography now. We're going to start PTC.</div>
<div><b>197:53:07 CC: </b>Roger, Al. And one item on - for the Surgeon here. He noticed, after the probe stowage exercise, your EKG data and Ed's ZFN data degraded to - useless actually; and we'd like you to check your external leads, and Ed to check his ZPN leads, and also where Ed's leads go into the transmitter box.</div>
<div><b>197:53:38 Shepard: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>197:53:40 Roosa: </b>Okay, Gordo.</div>
<div><b>197:57:25 Shepard: </b>How does the CDR look now, Houston?</div>
<div><b>197:57:31 CC: </b>Al, yours looks good now.</div>
<div><b>197:57:37 Shepard: </b>Okay, one of my leads has a stripped thread so, it may or may not hold. Just keep me advised, and I'll tighten up from time to time.</div>
<div><b>197:57:49 CC: </b>Okay, thank you.</div>
<div><b>197:57:56 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>197:57:58 CC: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>197:58:00 Roosa: </b>Hey, Gordon, I don't want to make a big point out of it, but I just - broaden the education on this P23 here. I've been noticing, you know, except for when we shot the Moon and we dropped that difference between the vectors down to about 30 miles, it's been running rather consistently 50 to 55 to 60. Do the P23 specialists or that - Is that the way they think it - it should be working?</div>
<div><b>197:58:29 CC: </b>Stand by. We'll get you an answer.</div>
<div><b>197:58:40 CC: </b>Stu, the answer to the question is yes. That's the way they think it ought to work.</div>
<div><b>197:58:54 Roosa: </b>Okay; very good.</div>
<div><b>198:03:34 ?Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>198:03:36 CC: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>198:03:38 Roosa: </b>Okay, would you like to copy the command module RCS TEMPs?</div>
<div><b>198:03:46 CC: </b>Roger; go ahead.</div>
<div><b>198:03:50 Roosa: </b>. Okay, systems test meter reading 5-C, 4.6; 5-Dog, 4.6; 6-Alfa, 4.4; 6-Bravo, 4.6; 6-Charlie, 4.5; 6-Dog, 4.5.</div>
<div><b>198:04:16 CC: </b>Okay, Stu, we got all of those.</div>
<div><b>198:04:20 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>198:11:44 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>198:11:48 Shepard: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>198:11:49 CC: </b>We're in a.good attitude. We're also configured to take the presleep E-MOD at any time.</div>
<div><b>198:12:00 Shepard: </b>Okay, we'll spin up here shortly, and we'll give you a 74 right now.</div>
<div><b>198:12:05 CC: </b>Roger. i</div>
<div><b>198:12:11 Shepard: </b>You've got it.</div>
<div><b>198:12:44 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>198:12:49 Shepard: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>198:12:57 CC: </b>The attitude I was referring to is for getting the dump. I think that - We'd just like to remind you to be sure to complete most of your dumps before spinning up. There's no hurry to go into PTC if you want to just sit in that attitude; there?s no thermal problems. Over.</div>
<div><b>198:13:17 Shepard: </b>Oh, okay; I misunderstood you, Gordo.</div>
<div><b>198:13:30 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>199:23:38 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>199:23:54 CC: </b>14, this is Gold Flight. Before you guys sign off for tonight, on behalf of all the guys on the Gold Team that have worked during this mission, we want to tip our hat to you for a super job; and we?re looking forward to you getting back here to the ranch; and we'll talk about it over a cool one.</div>
<div><b>199:24:04 Roosa: </b>We - we thank you, Jerry. A11s not on the loop right now. We'll pass that on to him. But we sure appreciate the support. You all really do good work.</div>
<div><b>199:24:15 CC: </b>Well, thank you very much. We enjoyed it.</div>
<div><b>199:24:18 Mitchell: </b>Jerry, your guys really did a super job on PDI day. That was wonderful.</div>
<div><b>199:24:28 CC: </b>Yes. We'll have to get together with the LM guys. Of course, they've already secured in their operations. But I agree with you. They and all their support people really hung in there and got up the answers that we needed.</div>
<div><b>199:24:39 Mitchell: </b>They sure did. It was a great show.</div>
<div><b>199:24:43 Roosa: </b>Hey, hang loose for a minute, Jerry; Al's getting on a headset here.</div>
<div><b>199:25:10 Shepard: </b>Jerry.</div>
<div><b>199:25:11 CC: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>199:25:14 Shepard: </b>Sorry, you caught me right in the middle of a drink of cof - cocoa.</div>
<div><b>199:25:19 CC: </b>Sorry about that.</div>
<div><b>199:25:21 Shepard: </b>You al 1 - you all about to leave right now, huh?</div>
<div><b>199:25:23 CC: </b>Well, we'll be on for a few more hours. But we -This is our last shift; and then, Orange Team's going to pick it up; and then, you'll have Maroon for entry.</div>
<div><b>199:25:36 Shepard: </b>Well, we'll be talking to you directly in a few days, but I sure do want to thank you for that superb job you did for us, especially down there around those low altitudes. Everything went real fine, and we appreciate your persistence that I know you had in getting that job done right. It's a hell of a thrill for us to work with you, Jer.</div>
<div><b>199:25:56 CC: </b>Yes. We had a real ball at it, Al. We'll be looking forward to getting that cool one when you get back here.</div>
<div><b>199:26:01 Shepard: </b>Sounds good, Jerry. Give my thanks to all the troups.</div>
<div><b>199:26:06 CC: </b>Okay. Wilco.</div>
<div><b>199:51:50 Roosa: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>199:51:53 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>199:52:12 CC: </b>14, Houston. Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>199:52:18 Roosa: </b>Houston, do you read? 14.</div>
<div><b>199:52:20 CC: </b>Roger. You're loud and clear now, Stu.</div>
<div><b>199:52:23 Roosa: </b>Okay. Do our rates still look good enough for spinup?</div>
<div><b>199:52:29 CC: </b>That's affirmative. Rates are GO.</div>
<div><b>199:52:36 Roosa: </b>Oops. I just heard a - I just felt a thruster fire. Maybe we?ll just set here for a minute, and you take a look at it.</div>
<div><b>199:52:43 CC: </b>That was a roll jet, so that, shouldn't hurt anything.</div>
<div><b>199:52:48 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>199:52:52 CC: </b>And on the comm, you can go straight to OMNI mode. In the checklist there, select OMNI Bravo and mark the HIGH GAIN at minus 52, PITCH; and plus 270, YAW. Over.</div>
<div><b>199:53:14 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Gordon. We'll do it.</div>
<div><b>199:53:17 CC: </b>A couple of other items before we bid you goodnight . The - your - Ed, your ZPN has showed no change so far, if you've had any chance to look at it. And we'd like to suggest one - -</div>
<div><b>199:53:31 Mitchell: </b>What?</div>
<div><b>199:53:32 CC: </b>Your ZPN data.</div>
<div><b>199:53:38 Mitchell: </b>Okay. ...</div>
<div><b>199:53:43 CC: </b>The - the other procedure we?d like to suggest -upon awakening in the morning - that will LMProve your L over D slightly. We'd like to ask you to close the POTABLE TANK INLET valve, and that'll divert the water you use after you wake up to the waste tank and let the potable tank decrease, which will give us a hair better L over D; and, I guess, every little bit helps. Over.</div>
<div><b>199:54:15 Mitchell: </b>Okay. We understand.</div>
<div><b>199:54:17 CC: </b>Okay. That's to be done in the morning, not now.</div>
<div><b>199:54:23 Mitchell: </b>Roger. Understand.</div>
<div><b>199:54:25 CC: </b>And, of course, it will - -</div>
<div><b>199:54:27 Roosa: </b>What - have you heard yet - have you heard an L over D figure being kicked around, Gordon?</div>
<div><b>199:54:34 CC: </b>Let me get one for you, Stu.</div>
<div><b>199:54:45 CC: </b>If - if you'd turn that tank valve off just before you start using water for breakfast, you should end up with an L over D of just shy of 0.28. . Over.</div>
<div><b>199:55:01 Roosa: </b>Okay. Copy 0.28, if we do the water bit.</div>
<div><b>199:55:06 CC: </b>Okay. And I think the only thing remaining is the onboard read-out. Standing by any time.</div>
<div><b>199:55:33 Roosa: </b>Okay, Gordon. BAT C is 37.0; ... 7.3; 37.3. Get the RCS in a second - 58 for quad Delta; 57, quad Charlie; 55, quad Baker; and 59, quad Able.</div>
<div><b>199:56:06 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. We copy all those.</div>
<div><b>194:507:56 Shepard: </b>Well, you saw the whole action on television. I missed the first one. The second one went, perhaps , a couple of hundred yards; and the third one, perhaps, about 400 yards, which was not bad for a six iron.</div>
<div><b>207:21:14 CC: </b>Hello, 14; Houston.</div>
<div><b>207:21:43 Mitchell: </b>Houston, Apollo 14. Good morning, Fredo,</div>
<div><b>207:21:47 CC: </b>Good morning, Ed. Down the home stretch. I show you're about 55 grand out, now. I got a few things here for you, if you got a flight plan handy.</div>
<div><b>207:22:03 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Let me get some lights on first, Fred.</div>
<div><b>207:22:07 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>207:23:25 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Fredo; go ahead with your updates.</div>
<div><b>207:23:30 CC: </b>Okay, first we got a consumables update; GET of 208 hours; 44.0; quad A, 44.9; B, 41.0; C, 45.7; and D, 44.4; H^ tank 1, 30.7; and 2, 29.2; 0^ tank 1, 63.3; 2, 65*0; 3 is 10.9; and why don't you go ahead with that readback - if you want, Ed - first.</div>
<div><b>207:24:30 Mitchell: </b>Okay. 208.00; 44, RCS total; quads, 44.9, 41.0, 45.7, 44.4; hydrogen, ... .7, 29.2; oxygen..... * ? 15 10?9 ?</div>
<div><b>207:24:55 CC: </b>Okay. Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>207:25:18 CC: </b>Okay, 14; how do you read now? We had to get the VOGAs off the line.</div>
<div><b>207:25:24 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Loud and clear, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>207:25:26 CC: </b>Yes, you're good now. Right to the left of the consumables update block, there's a VERB 29 maneuver to the optics CAL attitude at about 208:30; and your HIGH GAIN angles there should - should be PITCH, minus 73; and the YAW number there should be .102.</div>
<div><b>207:26:01 Mitchell: </b>Okay. That's corrected. Thank you. 102.</div>
<div><b>207:26:05 CC: </b>Okay - and let's see - we'd like the potty tank inlet valve to close, so we can get a little more water into the waste tank.</div>
<div><b>207:26:23 Mitchell: </b>Okay, I'll do that right now.</div>
<div><b>207:28:11 CC: </b>And, 14; Houston. You still there?</div>
<div><b>207:28:16 Mitchell: </b>That's affirm, and the potty tank's closed off.</div>
<div><b>207:28:20 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. Let's see. They'd like here the readouts that you have there for the onboard PITCH and YAW S-band meters. And also the dials.</div>
<div><b>207:28:44 Mitchell: </b>Okay - at this moment, you mean?</div>
<div><b>207:28:47 CC: </b>That's affirm, Ed.</div>
<div><b>207:28:53 Mitchell: </b>Yes. It looks like at this moment, they're setting at - plus 60 and 360. And the thumbwheels are sitting at minus 52 and 270.</div>
<div><b>207:29:15 CC: </b>Okay, copied, Ed.</div>
<div><b>207:30:13 CC: </b>And, 14; Houston.</div>
<div><b>207:30:22 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Fred.</div>
<div><b>207:30:23 CC: </b>Okay, we?ve got that number 3 tank down low enough now; so, hereafter - just in case you're wondering we'll keep tanks - O<sub>2</sub> TANKs 1 and 2 in AUTO, and we111 leave TANK number 3 , OFF, O-F-F.</div>
<div><b>207:30:42 Mitchell: </b>Okay. That's my current, configuration, and I understand it will stay that way.</div>
<div><b>207:30:47 CC: </b>Roger, Ed. And we've got the torque angles okay.</div>
<div><b>207:30:56 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>207:31:01 CC: </b>And let's see, 14; one other note here they missed - says they missed getting a presleep medication report - and from that I assume you didn't have any medication. Is that correct?</div>
<div><b>207:31:15 Mitchell: </b>That's a good assumption.</div>
<div><b>207:31:17 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>207:31:27 CC: </b>Okay, 14. I've got one other thing which concerns verifying where you've got some stowage, and it's not too time-critical - so, if you want to - go ahead and get cleaned up first and just give me a call when you want to talk about that.</div>
<div><b>207:31:44 Mitchell: </b>Okay. .</div>
<div><b>207:31:50 Mitchell: </b>Got anything that's outstanding we owe you right now, Fredo - like checklist - -</div>
<div><b>207:31:56 CC: </b>No, I think we've got everything taken care of except finding out for sure where you got all the bags.</div>
<div><b>207:32:00 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Well, right now,, we don't have them all - we don't have them all stowed, but we know exactly where we're going to put them, and we'll be starting that before long.</div>
<div><b>207:32:15 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>207:34:38 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14. Fredo, did you get the NOUN 93s pertaining to ...?</div>
<div><b>207:34:44 CC: </b>That's affirm, 14. We got those.</div>
<div><b>207:34:48 Mitchell: </b>Okay, the time we're using is 208:11:05.</div>
<div><b>207:34:51 CC: </b>Roger; 208:11:05.</div>
<div><b>207:39:31 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14.</div>
<div><b>207:39:35 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>207:39:38 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Postsleep report. On sleep, A1 and Stu had 4 hours each; I had 6. On the PRD, A1 is 16o62; Ed, 07060.</div>
<div><b>207:40:01 CC: </b>Okay. Copied sleep report - or postsleep report; 4, 4, and'6 hours, with you getting the 6, and I copied the other numbers - dosimeters.</div>
<div><b>207:40:17 Mitchell: </b>Roger. And I was the one on the headset, too.</div>
<div><b>207:40:42 CC: </b>Hey, are you reading, Ed?</div>
<div><b>207:40:48 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>207:40:51 CC: </b>Hey, you can tell Stu I watched the press conference, and I hope he didn't let all the lunar fines out there.</div>
<div><b>207:41:01 Mitchell: </b>He did a pretty good job of letting part of them.</div>
<div><b>207:41:05 CC: </b>Yes, I could see that.</div>
<div><b>207:41:06 Roosa: </b>..., Fred?</div>
<div><b>207:41:10 Mitchell: </b>We've got it all cleaned up now, though.</div>
<div><b>207:41:14 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>207:41:15 Roosa: </b>We don't have any dust in here, Fred. You can see that.</div>
<div><b>207:47:54 CC: </b>And, 14; Houston. We'd like the high gain cranked up when you get at it there.</div>
<div><b>207:48:03 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Fredo. Stand by 1.</div>
<div><b>207:48:33 Roosa: </b>And you got her, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>207:48:36 CC: </b>Okay. Thank you. .</div>
<div><b>208:27:06 CC: </b>Not bad, Stu.</div>
<div><b>208:27:10 Roosa: </b>Well, I'm not sure whether It's good or bad, Fred. I think we probably need some update. That doesn't help me much.</div>
<div><b>208:27:27 CC: </b>Well, Dave here says you're looking pretty close.</div>
<div><b>208:27:46 CC: </b>Or maybe it's like the old saying, even the blind squirrel finds a nut, now and then.</div>
<div><b>208:27:55 Roosa: </b>Hey, you're just all heart this morning, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>208:28:05 CC: </b>Didn't want you overconfident.</div>
<div><b>208:28:26 CC: </b>And, Stu, Dave wonders if you want to proceed from here, maybe, and look at the DELTA-Vs and P37, and he'll compare with you.</div>
<div><b>208:28:39 Roosa: </b>Okay. We might try that, depending on the time here; still a little stowage I want to get on.</div>
<div><b>208:28:47 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>208:46:53 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>208:46:56 Shepard: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>208:46:58 CC: </b>Hey, just thought Stu would be interested. After his last sets of marks there, we have his gamma, now, down to within about 0.05 degrees; and altitude, against ours, about - within 4/10ths of a mile. .</div>
<div><b>208:47:18 Shepard: </b>I knew he would get a little bit better with his marks.</div>
<div><b>209:07:24 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14,</div>
<div><b>209:07:28 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>209:07:32 Mitchell: </b>Fredo, we're starting into getting these bags stowed in here. You said you had a storage update for us - ... we have.</div>
<div><b>209:07:42 CC: </b>I'm not sure it's an update, Ed. You may have already gotten the word, but there was a conflict in a note that RETRO had on one of them. And it indicated maybe you had put it in a different spot. And--</div>
<div><b>209:08:00 Mitchell: </b>... I don't knew which one you're referring to, but go ahead and let's hear it.</div>
<div><b>209:08:08 CC: </b>Okay. I'll just read - there's only three items -three items; and one says that the 30-pound bag will be put on A-13, the 20-pound bag on A-8, and Stu's suit with the helmet and a sleeping bag will be on top of the - also on top of A-8.</div>
<div><b>209:08:39 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Stand by just a minute.</div>
<div><b>209:08:50 Mitchell: </b>Fredo, we were putting the 20-pounder on A-8 with the suit on top of it. Is that the way you want it now?</div>
<div><b>209:08:57 CC: </b>That's correct.</div>
<div><b>209:09:00 Mitchell: </b>Okay. That?s the way we're going.</div>
<div><b>209:09:02 CC: </b>Very good.</div>
<div><b>209:20:09 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>209:20:12 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>209:20:15 CC: </b>Okay, Ed. Would you verify the FANS, OFF?</div>
<div><b>209:20:21 Mitchell: </b>Stand by, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>209:20:40 MP: </b>Okay, they're OFF now.</div>
<div><b>209:20:42 CC: </b>Roger, Ed.</div>
<div><b>209:24:22 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>209:24:25 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>209:24:27 CC: </b>Okay. You all can crank the carrousel up there anytime. And before you do, we'd like you to check the S-BAND PITCH knob at minus 40, YAW at 90, REACQ, and we'd like MEDIUM BEAM width now.</div>
<div><b>209:24:53 Mitchell: </b>Okay. You want minus 40, 90, REACQ, and we're ready to spin up.</div>
<div><b>209:24:58 CC: </b>Okay. And that was MEDIUM BEAM width, Ed.</div>
<div><b>209:25:02 Mitchell: </b>Roger. MEDIUM BEAM width.</div>
<div><b>209:54:00 CC: </b>14, Houston.</div>
<div><b>209:54:05 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>209:54:07 CC: </b>Okay. We won't be needing MCC-7-</div>
<div><b>209:54:13 Mitchell: </b>Roger. Said no MC-7 - MCC-7- Thank you, Fredo.</div>
<div><b>209:54:17 CC: </b>...</div>
<div><b>210:05:23 Mitchell: </b>Houston, Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>210:05:27 CC: </b>Go ahead, 14.</div>
<div><b>210:05:31 Mitchell: </b>Let me give you command module RCS injector valve TEMPs.</div>
<div><b>210:05:37 CC: </b>Okay. Go ahead, Ed.</div>
<div><b>210:05:39 Mitchell: </b>Okay. SYSTEMS TEST meter: 5 Charlie, 4.4; 5 Delta, 5.1; 6 Alfa, 4.5; Bravo, 4.4; Coco, 4.4; and Delta, 4.5*</div>
<div><b>210:05:58 CC: </b>Okay. We?ve got them in.</div>
<div><b>210:32:08 Mitchell: </b>Houston, Apollo 14.</div>
<div><b>210:32:11 CC: </b>Go ahead, -14. Over.</div>
<div><b>210:32:15 Mitchell: </b>Hello, Bruce. Say, I thought I'd try to make the surgeon happy for the last 4 or 5 hours in the flight. Have him check my bictned now, please.</div>
<div><b>210:32:22 CC: </b>Roger, Ed. Understand you'd like a biomed-harness integrity and telemetry check. Over.</div>
<div><b>210:32:29 Mitchell: </b>That's affirmative.</div>
<div><b>210:32:31 CC: </b>Okay. We'll get them going on it.</div>
<div><b>210:35:31 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. The surgeon reports that they have good data on all crewmen, with the exception of Ed's respiration rate. The ZPN sensors are still not getting through on telemetry; however, don't worry about it at this time. They're happy with what they've got; and, medically, you're GO for entry. Over.</div>
<div><b>210:35:56 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Well, I just replaced one sensor that had come loose. I thought maybe that was the one causing the problem.</div>
<div><b>210:36:03 CC: </b>Okay. Right now, we're not getting your respiration rate. Which one did you - which one did you replace, Ed?</div>
<div><b>210:36:14 Mitchell: </b>Actually, I replaced the top outer, not on the sternum, the one to the right.</div>
<div><b>210:36:23 CC: </b>Okay. Understand the upper one on the right side of your chest, not on the sternum. Over.</div>
<div><b>210:36:29 Mitchell: </b>That's affirm. And, on the respiration here, let's see if I can press them and get them coming in. Yes, tell them to watch it now.</div>
<div><b>210:36:41 CC: </b>Okay. They're watching. All right.</div>
<div><b>210:37:46 CC: </b>And, 14, this is Houston. When you select OMNI Charlie, would you give us a call, so that we can send you a COMMAND RESET? Over.</div>
<div><b>210:37:57 Mitchell: </b>Okay. I was just getting ready to do that when you called. It's going in now.</div>
<div><b>210:38:00 CC: </b>Roger. Thank you.</div>
<div><b>210:41:18 CC: </b>14, Ed; this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>210:41:22 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>210:41:23 CC: </b>We have seen no change in your LMPedance pneumograph. We suspect that it may be a problem in the signal conditioner. And the Surgeons thank you for your efforts in attempting to restore the axillary leads, but suggest that you just leave it as is for entry and not bother with it any further. Over.</div>
<div><b>210:41:45 Mitchell: </b>Okay, I was pulling and tugging, and I'm convinced the sensor and harness is okay, Bruce. So, I agree with you; it must be somewhere down stream.</div>
<div><b>210:41:54 CC: </b>Roger; the feeling is that it's probably in the signal conditioner.</div>
<div><b>210:42:58 Mitchell: </b>Okay, tell them not to worry. I'll hold my breath; and then, they'll know what the rate is.</div>
<div><b>210:43:04 CC: </b>Say, that sounds like a pretty good plan. Give us a mark when you start holding; and then, we'll time frcm. there.</div>
<div><b>210:43:12 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>210:43:14 CC: </b>Either that, or the Surgeons say that if - if you give us a mark when you start holding your breath, we'11 give you a mark when the EKG goes flat. Over</div>
<div><b>210:43:24 Mitchell: </b>That's a fair enough exchange.</div>
<div><b>210:44:36 CC: </b>14, Houston. The information that you sent us down on the systems test meter leads us to cancel the command module RCS preheat, as you probably surmised by now. We just wanted to make sure we were both on the same frequency. Over.</div>
<div><b>210:44:51 Mitchell: </b>Okay, we concur. Thank you, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>210:56:55 CC: </b>Apollo 14, Stu. This is Houston.</div>
<div><b>210:56:59 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>210:57:00 CC: </b>Roger. In looking at your NOUN 49 values, we're scratching our heads on the magnitude of the DELTA-R and the DELTA-V updates. Would you verify that - the first star, you were, in fact, using the far horizon; and on this one, you are using the near horizon. Over.</div>
<div><b>210:57:19 Roosa: </b>That's affirmative. I worried about that, too -at the size of them, Bruce. And I verify this one for sure on the near horizon; and you know, I'm 99 percent certain on - on the other one. I really didn't - I reshot and got that same large update, and thought it was pretty good, but I didn't see them taper down like they should have. I'm mystified, also.</div>
<div><b>210:57:45 CC: </b>Okay. Well, we're not meaning to - to try and backseat drive. We're trying to figure it out for you, also; and we wanted to confirm that before we went too much further. Over.</div>
<div><b>210:57:55 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>211:03:14 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. I have your reentry pad whenever you're ready to copy. Over.</div>
<div><b>211:03:40 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Houston. Ready to copy.</div>
<div><b>211:03:43 CC: </b>Roger. And would you confirm that star 23 was loaded in P23 this time? It looked like 22 as it went by us.</div>
<div><b>211:03:53 Roosa: </b>Roger; it was 22, Bruce. I went back on and checked that first star again, and I?m afraid that is the trouble - I shot the wrong horizon on the star 22.</div>
<div><b>211:04:26 Roosa: </b>And, Bruce, would you suggest that I shoot that over again? See if we can take that error out?</div>
<div><b>211:04:47 CC: </b>Stu, this is Houston. Go ahead and shoot star 22 over again, and we?ll have some more detailed word for you on the sequence after that in a minute.</div>
<div><b>211:04:57 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>211:05:10 CC: </b>And after reshooting star 22, Stu, you can press on to star 23; and there's no need to redo 64. Over.</div>
<div><b>211:05:19 Roosa: </b>Okay. .</div>
<div><b>211:05:24 CC: </b>And, Ed, if you're ready, I've got the entry pad.</div>
<div><b>211:05:29 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Let's copy.</div>
<div><b>211:05:31 CC: </b>Roger.

Comments: Use 1, nonexit EMS pattern; 2, Moon check, Moon in left of window: roll 000, 182, 000; 3, Moonset GET, 216 plus 25 plus 15- HET of 90,000 feet, 6 plus 29. Main deploy, 8 plus 54. Landing, 13 plus 52. Constant-g entry is roll right. GDC aline, 322, 325, 018. And for your information, the MSFN values of. gamma at entry interface are minus 6.39, comparing with the navigated value prior to this last set of P23s of minus 6.42. The MSFN vacuum perigee, 20.6. Your onboard vacuum perigee, 20.1. And back under GDC aline, it's Sirius and Rigel for the stars. Read back. Over.</div>
<div><b>211:09:14 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Bruce, we have a MEDPAC landing at zero -Roll, pitch, and yaw: 000, 154, 000; 216:10:47; 267; minus 27.02, minus 172.65; MAX g is 06.2; 36170, 6.39; 1140.2, 36251; 216:27:47; 00:29; Dq is 4.00, 02:09; 00:18, 03:33, 08:07; sextant star, 30, 354.3, 30.7; Nu Hydra, up 21.1, left 2.8, lift vector, up. Use nonexit EMS pattern.</div>
<div><b>211:10:30 Mitchell: </b>Okay, for the Moon-check attitude, it's in the left of the window; and we should be at roll 000, 182, 000; and Moonset is at 216:25:15. RET of 90 K is 06:29; mains are 08:54; landing's at 13:52. For constant-g, roll right. GDC aline stars are Sirius and Rigel, with angles of 322, 325, 0l8, The MSFN entry gamma is minus 6.39-Onboard gamma, 6.42. Hp is 20.6 and 20.1.</div>
<div><b>211:11:20 CC: </b>Roger, 14. Readback correct. Out.</div>
<div><b>211:16:24 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>211:16:29 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>211:16:31 CC: </b>After you have finished with this P23, Stu, we will uplink to you a new MSFN state vector for the CSM and load it into the IM state vector slot and leave it there until time to uplink you our final MSFN state vector, which will ccme about - come after your'last set of P23s. And for your information, in the event that we should have communications problems, the CSM state vector that we read up to you in the pad yesterday would be acceptable for conducting an entry. Over.</div>
<div><b>211:17:17 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>211:30:46 CC: </b>...</div>
<div><b>211:31:45 CC: </b>14, this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>211:31:48 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>211:31:50 CC: </b>After Stu finishes his marks on this last star, we'd like him to stand by for a possible rerun of star 22, in the present attitude and configuration; we also have to do a ground-tracking-station handover here, and we'll do that after he finishes marking on this star and advise you. Over.</div>
<div><b>211:32:15 Mitchell: </b>Understand.</div>
<div><b>211:39:13 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. If you'll give us P00 and ACCEPT, we'd like to uplink to you a new CSM state vector for the LM slot. The - the desired orientation and entry LAT and LONG. Over.</div>
<div><b>211:39:28 Mitchell: </b>You've got it.</div>
<div><b>211:39:29 CC: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>211:46:53 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We have finished with the uplink. The computer's yours. Our recanmendation on the P23 sightings is that you return to star 22 and take additional marks until you are satisfied with the magnitude of the DELTA-R, DELTA-V updates, or until we start running shy on time. It looks now like we can slip the initial P52 you have scheduled at 212 hours down to about 213 hours, since we have canceled midcourse 7. Over.</div>
<div><b>211:47:29 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. Just keep shooting star 22, only.</div>
<div><b>211:47:33 CC: </b>That's affirmative. The marks that you took that drove the state vector out were those derived frcm star 22, and I'm informed that the fastest way to bring your state vector back in would be to put in compensatory marks from the same general direction. Over.</div>
<div><b>211:47:52 Roosa: </b>Okay. We'll give it a go.</div>
<div><b>211:58:30 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We show your computed value of vacuum perigee coming down into agreement with the MSFN value at the rate of about 2 miles or so per mark on star 22. Over.</div>
<div><b>211:58:49 Roosa: </b>Yes, Bruce. The way I figure it, I've got about 16 marks to go.</div>
<div><b>211:58:53 CC: </b>Well, we were going to say 10 marks to go, but we thought you'd figure we were being sarcastic.</div>
<div><b>211:59:01 Roosa: </b>No, I'm looking at VERB 83, and she's coming down about - well, it was 30 miles - down about 25 miles a mark.</div>
<div><b>211:59:17 Roosa: </b>You know, I could have already been through if I had a recycle on this program.</div>
<div><b>211:59:23 CC: </b>Okay, I'll tell the MIN KEY boys about that.</div>
<div><b>212:13:57 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>212:14:01 Roosa: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>212:14:02 CC: </b>Stu, we're showing your calculation of vacuum perigee coming down only about 1 mile per mark at the present time. We've got about 21 miles for the MSFN solutions and about 53 for yours. We suggest that you terminate the P23 marking routines at this time and press on for the flight plan. Over.</div>
<div><b>212:14:28 Roosa: </b>Okay. Sounds like a good winner.</div>
<div><b>212:15:42 CC: </b>14, Houston. We copy your torquing angles.</div>
<div><b>212:15:54 Roosa: </b>Okay, and torquing is 212:58:50.</div>
<div><b>212:19:14 CC: </b>I'd suggest you give them a call on it so you could [aside] - -</div>
<div><b>212:19:17 Roosa: </b>* * ?</div>
<div><b>212:19:39 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Before torquing to the entry REFSMMAT, we recommend SCS - and check your LIMIT CYCLE switch, ON, please. Over.</div>
<div><b>212:19:50 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>212:28:18 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston.</div>
<div><b>212:28:49 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>212:28:52 Roosa: </b>Go ahead.</div>
<div><b>212:28:55 CC: </b>Okay, 14. We hadn't planned on any sort of a complete or comprehensive newscast this morning - on your way in to entry, as we figured you'd probably get a pretty good briefing after splashdown. There is one item I'd like to read up to you, however, if you have a minute.</div>
<div><b>212:29:17 Shepard: </b>Okay, go ahead with that - and we'd also be interested in what the weather is in the recovery area when you finish.</div>
<div><b>212:29:23 CC: </b>Okay, recovery area weather is about 1500 - or 2000 scattered, higher broken, winds from 100 degrees at 15 knots - the waves are - are two sets. You've got a batch of 2-foot waves with a 2-second period, and superLMPosed on them, you have some 4-foot waves with a 3-second period - and, in general, it looks pretty good. I can get some more details for you, if you're interested. Over.</div>
<div><b>212:29:53 Shepard: </b>Well, that's pretty good - unless it changes from that measurably, that sounds like it's not bad at all.</div>
<div><b>212:30:00 CC: </b>Right. And we'll have an update for you on the weather as you get closer to interface. This one is dateline Los Angeles. "A powerful earthquake hit southern California at 8:01 central standard time today, causing two reported deaths, numerous injuries, and cracked buildings and highways. The jolting trembler was felt over at least 350 miles from Fresno to below the Mexican border. But damage was worse in Los Angeles and its heavily populated San Fernando Valley. The center of the shock was reported at 17 miles north of the valley in the rugged San Gabriel Mountains. Major damage is reported in the two closest towns of Newhall and Saugus, 35 miles northwest of downtown L.A. The magnitude of the shock was rated at between 6 and 6.5 on the Richter scale, which rates major quakes at 7 or more. It was the strongest quake in the Los Angeles area since the 1952 trembler at Tehachapi to the north, which had the magnitude of 7.2 and was strongly felt in L.A. It killed 13 persons. The San Francisco earthquake was 8.25." Over.</div>
<div><b>212:31:11 Mitchell: </b>Well, looks like San Andreas is kicking up again.</div>
<div><b>213:07:10 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. Whenever it is convenient with you, we would like to press on with the logic sequence check and get that out of the way. And I understand that this 212 alarm is expected - as a consequence of the CMC self-check.</div>
<div><b>213:07:28 Mitchell: </b>Roger. We'll give you a buzz when we're ready to move out.</div>
<div><b>213:07:33 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>213:09:47 Mitchell: </b>Houston, on the logic sequences check, we're standing by for SECS LOGIC, on.</div>
<div><b>213:10:01 CC: </b>Stand by, please, 14.</div>
<div><b>213:10:13 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We show that the LOGIC power is on at the present time. Over.</div>
<div><b>213:10:24 Shepard: </b>That's affirmative - -</div>
<div><b>213:10:26 Mitchell: </b>We're standing by - -</div>
<div><b>213:10:27 Shepard: </b>We're standing by at the present time.</div>
<div><b>213:10:28 Mitchell: </b>Yes. We're standing by on the step SECS LOGIC, two on, up.</div>
<div><b>213:10:36 CC: </b>Okay. That's what we show as already having been accomplished. What is the position of your SECS LOGIC switches? Over.</div>
<div><b>213:10:45 Mitchell: </b>Okay. They are on, up. That was a cockpit error here. Okay, we're standing by for GO.</div>
<div><b>213:10:53 CC: </b>Roger, Ed. Your system is in a good configuration. Do not arm the pyros at this time; however, you would be GO, if you had desired to. Over.</div>
<div><b>213:11:04 Mitchell: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>213:43:34 Mitchell: </b>Eight ..,</div>
<div><b>213:43:39 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.</div>
<div><b>213:43:42 Mitchell: </b>Loud and clear, Houston.</div>
<div><b>213:43:44 CC: </b>Roger; reading you the same.</div>
<div><b>213:58:24 CC: </b>Torquing angles look good there, Stu.</div>
<div><b>213:58:28 Roosa: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>213:58:34 Shepard: </b>Okay, Houston. We?ll be torquing at 214:38:45.</div>
<div><b>213:58:41 CC: </b>Roger, A1.</div>
<div><b>214:03:12 CC: </b>Apollo 4 - Apollo 4 - Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over. Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:03:31 Shepard: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>214:03:33 CC: </b>Roger, 14.' We'd like to conduct the VHF SLMPLEX Alfa check at this time, if one of you can support it. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:03:52 Mitchell: </b>This is Apollo 14, on VHF Alfa. How do you read?</div>
<div><b>214:03:56 .CC.: </b>Okay, Ed. We're reading you loud with a - a little bit of garble. I understand you've turned off your S-BAND T/R, and you're coming at us VHF Alfa. Is that correct? Over,</div>
<div><b>214:04:06 Mitchell: </b>... I was coming at you simo that time. And I'm coming out VHF Alfa.</div>
<div><b>214:04:12 CC: </b>Roger. Standing by.</div>
<div><b>214:04:14 Mitchell: </b>Houston, Apollo 14. How do you read VHF Alfa?</div>
<div><b>214:04:18 CC: </b>Oh, loud and clear, VHF Alfa, Ed. How me?</div>
<div><b>214:04:22 Mitchell: </b>You can cut it down a little bit, Bruce; it's readable.</div>
<div><b>214:04:40 CC: </b>Okay. We're still over an hour - more likely, about an hour and 10 minutes out from the point we normally conduct the check, and chart is showing you about 17,000 miles out; so, I think it's a pretty good check. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:04:42 Mitchell: </b>Very good.</div>
<div><b>214:11:28 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:11:31 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>214:11:33 CC: </b>If you're interested, I have an update on the weather for you. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:11:39 Mitchell: </b>All right. Stand by. Okay, go ahead with your weather update.</div>
<div><b>214:11:44 CC: </b>Roger. At your planned landing area, the general condition is good. You've got 2000 feet scattered, high broken, and 10-mile visibility. The wind is 120 degrees at 15- Wave height is 4 feet, with a southerly swell of 4 feet. The altimeter is 3006 or minus 128-foot pressure altitude. GMT computed for your landing is 21:05 on the ninth. Sunrise was at 17:15 in the night; sunset at 06:20:00 on the tenth. That's for your G&N target point; and over at the constant-g target point, there's really no significant change between the order at the two places. Your recovery forces standing by are the landing platform helicopter, New Orleans, which is 5 miles from the target point. Swim 1 and 2, SH-3 helicopters in the vicinity of the target point, and the ship Ponchatoula at the backup target point; It's an A0, oiler. Other support, you've got Photo 1 and Relay 1, and SH-3 helicopters in the vicinity of the target point that are providing photo and voice coverage, and Samoa Rescue 1 and 2, HC-130s that are about 45 minutes away. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:13:35 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Houston. I believe I got all of that, and I hope to be in contact with the New Orleans then very soon.</div>
<div><b>214:13:44 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>214:17:26 Roosa: </b>And, Houston; 14. The EKE checks out real fine.</div>
<div><b>214:17:32 CC: </b>Roger, Stu. Copy EMS entry check complete.</div>
<div><b>214:23:59 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. If you could give us P00 and ACCEPT, we have your final state vector uplink for you. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:24:11 Roosa: </b>Okay, Bruce. You've got it.</div>
<div><b>214:24:14 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>214:26:16 CC: </b>14, Houston. We're through with the computer; the uplink's in, and you've got a MSEN state vector in both slots. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:26:32 Roosa: </b>Roger. Thank you, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>214:39:35 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:39:39 Mitchell: </b>Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>214:39:41 CC: </b>Okay, 14. I've got same changes to your entry pad. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:39:48 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Go ahead, Houston.</div>
<div><b>214:39:52 CC: </b>Okay. Under NOUN 60, gamma at 400,000 feet should be minus - should be 6.37 vice 6.39- I say again, 6.37. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:40:07 Mitchell: </b>Understand; 6.37.</div>
<div><b>214:40:09 .CC.: </b>EMS range-to-go should be 1138.1. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:40:18 Mitchell: </b>EMS range-to-go, 1138.1.</div>
<div><b>214:40:22 CC: </b>Okay. Time of V is going to be 02:10. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:40:32 Mitchell: </b>VCIRC? 02:10.</div>
<div><b>214:40:35 CC: </b>Time for ending blackout, 03:35. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:40:48 Mitchell: </b>End of blackout at 03:35.</div>
<div><b>214:40:51 CC: </b>Drogue, 08:05. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:40:58 Mitchell: </b>08:05.</div>
<div><b>214:41:01 CC: </b>90,000 feet, 6 plus 28; mains, 8 plus 53; and landing, 13 plus 51. That's knock 1 second off each of the last three. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:41:15 Mitchell: </b>Understand; 1 second off the last three.</div>
<div><b>214:41:18 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>214:43:13 Mitchell: </b>Houston, 14. We are planning on activating the RCS about minus 1 hour.</div>
<div><b>214:43:21 CC: </b>Say again, 14.</div>
<div><b>214:43:25 Mitchell: </b>We're planning on activating the command module RCS at about minus 1 hour.</div>
<div><b>214:43:30 CC: </b>Roger. We copy.</div>
<div><b>214:46:26 Roosa: </b>Okay, Houston. The LOGIC is on, and we're standing by for a GO for PYRO ARM.</div>
<div><b>214:46:31 CC: </b>Roger. We see the LOGIC on and stand by, please. Apollo 14, this is Houston. You are GO for PYRO ARM.</div>
<div><b>214:46:41 Roosa: </b>Roger, 14.</div>
<div><b>214:47:10 Roosa: </b>And we got both rings pressurized here.</div>
<div><b>214:47:14 CC: </b>Roger, 14. Okay. Both rings look good from down here, 14.</div>
<div><b>214:47:27 Roosa: </b>Jolly good.</div>
<div><b>214:50:43 CC: </b>Apollo 14, this is Houston. All your systems are looking good from down here, and you're in great shape for the entry. The - the carrier is 5 miles off the target point, so you can go ahead and land right at the target point. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:50:59 Mitchell: </b>They're up-Sun, I hope, - so they'll get a good picture of us.</div>
<div><b>214:51:07 Shepard: </b>Thank you for your kind words. Everything looks good up here. We are pressing on.</div>
<div><b>214:53:34 Mitchell: </b>Houston, stand by for a thruster test, ring 2.</div>
<div><b>214:53:37 CC: </b>Roger. We're standing by, Ed.</div>
<div><b>214:54:36 CC: </b>Okay. Ring 2 looked good to us.</div>
<div><b>214:54:41 Mitchell: </b>Okay.</div>
<div><b>214:55:18 Mitchell: </b>Okay, Houston. They?re both good to us.</div>
<div><b>214:55:32 CC: </b>14, this is Houston. We concur; both rings checked out good on the ground here, and we'd like to hold to the time line in the entry checklist as far as getting the batteries on, on the remainder of the events, go. Over.</div>
<div><b>214:55:45 Mitchell: </b>Okay. Hold on the,batteries, then.</div>
<div><b>214:55:48 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div><b>215:19:51 CC: </b>14, for your information, Samoa Rescue 1 and 2 are on station, and helicopters are in the air.</div>
<div><b>215:19:57 Shepard: </b>Sounds good, Bruce.</div>
<div><b>215:32:25 Shepard: </b>Houston, standing by for PYRO ARM.</div>
<div><b>215:32:30 CC: </b>GO for PYRO ARM.</div>
<div><b>215:32:51 Shepard: </b>Okay. We've had separation, Houston.</div>
<div><b>215:32:54 CC: </b>Roger.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>215:37:39 Shepard (onboard): </b>Don't see any horizon at all, huh?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>215:37:40 Roosa (onboard): </b>Net yet, no.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>215:37:41 Shepard (onboard): </b>Probably too much light in here. Why don't you flip your floods off and see if you can see a dark horizon.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>215:37:48 Roosa (onboard): </b>The Moon is awful bright. I sure don't. All I see is a -</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>215:38:04 Mitchell (onboard): </b>In other words, it must be shifting. Let's see, we've get - on the tape recorder - we have 30 minutes of high-bit-rate recording, don't we?</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>215:38:24 Roosa (onboard): </b>3C minutes? Yes. There's a decal down there that tells you that,. You might verify. I think it's 3C minutes for 4 hours or something.</div>
<div class="onboard"><b>215:38:32 Mitchell (onboard): </b>I thought there was, too, but I don't see it.</div>
