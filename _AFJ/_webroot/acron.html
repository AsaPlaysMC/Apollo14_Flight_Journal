<blockquote>
<b>Acquisition Of Signal</b><br>
The spacecraft has reacquired radio contract with Mission Control.  In Earth orbit this happens
when the spacecraft appears above the horizon of a communications station.  At the Moon,
this happens when the spacecraft reappears from behind the Moon.  During the coast phase
to and from the Moon, the spacecraft is in almost continuous contact with one of the main
ground stations.
