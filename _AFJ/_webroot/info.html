<h3><a name="burn"></a>Burn</h3>
<blockquote>
A burn is the process of firing a rocket motor(s)
in order to change the trajectory of
a spacecraft. For this reason, burns are always preceded by elaborate checks
to make sure the spacecraft is pointed in the right direction. The burn
itself is carefully monitored to make sure it's neither too short (under
burn), nor too long (over burn). At the end of the burn, the difference
between the expected an actual change in velocity, the so called
<a href="info.html#residuals">residuals</a>,
is carefully looked at to make sure the burn had the desired effect.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="capcom"></a>Capcom</h3>
<blockquote>
The Capcom (short for capsule communicator, a term left over from the Mercury days) was
essentially the single point of contact between the astronauts and the rest of the Mission
Control team.  The Capcom was also an astronaut who had gone through similar training and
had often even flown on a similar mission.
This made him an excellent filter between the crew and the rest of Mission Control.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="csmupdates"></a>CSM improvements</h3>
<blockquote>
As the result of the uncontained failure of an oxygen tank and the subsequent loss
of all SM systems on the Apollo 13 flight, numerous changes were made to the CSM, both to
prevent similar problems and to help the crew to better deal with any possible future
in-flight emergencies.
The oxygen tank was extensively modified to remove not only the destratification fans
and other potential ignition sources, but also all burnable materials (including aluminum).
A third oxygen tank was added on the other side of the SM from the two original tanks.
A 400 amp-hour battery and a contingency water system were added to provide power and water
in case of a complete loss of the fuel cells.
For a complete list of the Apollo 14 improvements, please have a look at
<a href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/">Apollo Lunar Surface Journal's</a> section on Apollo 14.

<h3><a NAME="doiburn"></a>DOI burn</h3>
<blockquote>
The DOI burn was performed behind the Moon, roughly opposite
to the intended landing point. It lowered the <a href="info.html#perilune">perilune</a>
to the optimal altitude for starting the actual lunar landing. On the Apollo
10, 11, and 12 missions, this burn was done using the LMs DPS after it
separated from the CSM. However, on the later, more scientific oriented
missions, the ability to explore the lunar surface was limited by the ability
of the LM to land the astronauts and their experiments on the surface and
to return them and their rocks to orbit.
On the later missions, in order to save LM fuel, the CM's SPS was used
for the DOI burn. This lowered the perilune of both spacecraft. After they
separated, the CSM did another burn to return to a circular orbit. Of course
for every kilo of LM fuel that was saved, the CSM had to burn several kilos
lowering both itself and the LM and then returning to a circular orbit.
This also increased the amount of the payload that the Saturn V had to
send towards the Moon. However, both the Saturn V and the CSM had ample
reserves.
</blockquote>

<h3><a NAME="flightplanning"></a>Flight Planning</h3>
<blockquote>
Although it requires knowledge of orbital mechanics, planning
a flight to the Moon is actually more of an art than a science. In fact, any
talented person with a little high school physics and a small computer,
can fairly accurately compute all the burns of an Apollo mission.
What made the task challenging was coming up
with reasonable compromises between achieving the maximum of mission objectives
while keeping the risk to the success of the mission acceptably small
and the risk to the astronauts very small. A good example of this is the
trade-off between carrying extra hovering fuel that may be needed to find
a safe landing spot and carrying additional scientific equipment. Its also
necessary to know what kind of problems could arise and to make the mission
robust enough to minimize the impact of these problems.
Not having enough reserve capacity would allow even minor problems to
jeopardize the mission, but requiring too much backup would greatly reduce the
useful payload.
The ability to make these comprises accurately made Apollo possible.
The ability to come up with the right mixture of bold leaps and cautious
steps in both the planning of the missions and the design of the launch
vehicle and spacecraft made Apollo an unprecedented and unmatched
success.

<h3><a name="freereturn"></a>Free return trajectory</h3>
<blockquote>
If a spacecraft is aimed carefully enough, it can leave the
Earth, fly out in front of the onrushing Moon, be pulled around the back
of the Moon by its gravity and hurled back towards the Earth, and finally
make a perfect reentry into the Earths atmosphere. Although this level
of accuracy is hard to obtain, it is quite easy to come close enough that
only minor
<a href="info.html#mccburn">mid course correction</a> burns
are necessary. These trajectories are regarded as being inherently safe
since the spacecraft is already on a its way back to a safe landing as
soon as it leaves Earth orbit.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="f1desc"></a>F-1 engine</h3>
<blockquote>
<a href="pics/f-1_big.jpg" target="new"><img src="pics/f-1_small.jpg" width=688 height=642
alt="Labelled diagram of F-1 engine"></a>
<p>
An F-1 engine weighs about 8 tons [8.4 metric tons], is 19 feet [5.8 m] long,
and has a nozzle exit diameter of over 12 feet [3.7 m].
It's a single start, bipropellant engine burning LOX (liquid oxygen) and RP-1 (rocket
propellant one, essentially highly refined kerosene).
At lift off it produces 1,520,000 pounds [6,760 kN] of thrust.
This increases to about 1,780,000 pounds [7,920 kN] at center engine cut-off.
A large combustion chamber and nozzle make up the bulk of the engine.
The top of the combustion chamber consists of an injector plate through which
RP-1 fuel and LOX are injected at high pressure.
Above the injector is the LOX dome which also transmits the force of the thrust
from the engine to the rocket's structure. A single-shaft turbopump is mounted beside
the combustion chamber.
The turbine is at the bottom and is driven by the exhaust gas from burning RP-1 and LOX
in a fuel-rich mixture in a gas generator. After powering the turbine,
the exhaust gas passes through a heat exchanger, then to a wrap-around exhaust
manifold which feeds it into the periphery of the engine bell.
The final task for these hot gases is to cool and protect the
nozzle extension from the far hotter exhaust of the main engine itself.
Above the turbine, on the same shaft, is the fuel pump with two inlets from
the fuel tank and two outlets going, via shutoff valves, to the injector plate.
A line from one of these 'feeds' supplies the gas generator with fuel.
Fuel is also used within the engine as a lubricant and as a hydraulic working fluid,
though before launch, RJ-1 ramjet fuel is supplied from the ground for this purpose.
At the top of the turbopump shaft is the LOX pump with a single, large inlet
in-line with the turboshaft axis. This pump also has two outlet lines, with valves,
to feed the injector plate. One line also supplies LOX to the gas generator.
The interior lining of the combustion chamber and engine bell consists of
a myriad of pipework through which a large portion of the fuel supply is fed.
This cools the chamber and bell structure while also pre-warming the fuel.
Lastly, an igniter, containing a cartridge of hypergolic fluid with burst diaphragms
at either end, is in the high pressure fuel circuit and has its own injection
point in the combustion chamber. This fluid is triethylboron with 10-15% triethylaluminium.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="f1start"></a>F-1 start</h3>
<blockquote>
The ignition sequence of an F-1 engine is a complicated affair with many interrelated
events happening almost simultaneously.
<p>
At T minus 8.9 seconds, a signal from the automatic sequencer fires four
pyrotechnic devices. Two cause the fuel rich turbine exhaust gas to ignite when it enters the engine bell.
Another begins combustion within the gas generator while the fourth ignites the exhaust from the turbine.
Links are burned away by these igniters to generate an electrical signal to move the start solenoid.
The start solenoid directs hydraulic pressure from the ground supply to open the main LOX valves.
LOX begins to flow through the LOX pump, starting it to rotate, then into the combustion chamber.
The opening of both LOX valves also causes a valve to allow fuel and LOX into the gas generator,
where they ignite and accelerate the turbine. Fuel and LOX pressures rise as the turbine gains speed.
The fuel-rich exhaust from the gas generator ignites in the engine bell to prevent backfiring
and burping of the engine.
The increasing pressure in the fuel lines opens a valve, the igniter fuel valve,
letting fuel pressure reach the hypergol cartridge which promptly ruptures.
Hypergolic fluid, followed by fuel, enters the chamber through its port where
it spontaneously ignites on contact with the LOX already in the chamber.
<p>
Rising combustion-induced pressure on the injector plate actuates the ignition monitor valve,
directing hydraulic fluid to open the main fuel valves. These are the valves in the fuel lines between
the turbopump and the injector plate. The fuel flushes out ethylene glycol which had been preloaded
into the cooling pipework around the combustion chamber and nozzle.
The heavy load of ethylene glycol mixed with the first injection of fuel slows the
buildup of thrust, giving a gentler start. Fluid pressure through calibrated orifices
completes the opening of the fuel valves and fuel enters the combustion chamber where
it burns in the already flaming gases. The exact time that the main fuel valves open
is sequenced across the five engines to spread the rise in applied force that the structure of
the rocket must withstand.
<p>
As fuel and LOX flow increase to maximum, the rise in chamber pressure,
and therefore thrust, is monitored to confirm that the required force has been achieved.
With the turbopump at full speed, fuel pressure exceeds hydraulic pressure supplied
from ground equipment. Check valves switch the engine's hydraulic supply to be fed
from the rocket's fuel instead of from the ground.

<h3><a name="gloads"></a>G-loads during launch</h3>
<blockquote>
<img SRC="pics/gforce.gif" width=472 height=434 alt="Graph of g-forces during flight">
<p>
The above graph was derived from the Flight Evaluation Report for Apollo 14 and
displays how the acceleration of the vehicle changed throughout the boost,
from 1g at the launch pad to weightlessness less than 12 minutes later.
The key events in the graph are:
<ol>
<li>Launch with ignition of the S-IC. Note how the acceleration rapidly rises
with increasing engine efficiency and reduced fuel load.</li>
<li>Cut-off of the center engine of the S-IC.</li>
<li>Outboard engine cut-off of the S-IC at a peak of 3.8g.</li>
<li>S-II stage ignition. Note the reduced angle of the graph for although the
mass of the first stage has been discarded, the thrust of the S-II stage is
nearly one tenth of the final S-IC thrust.</li>
<li>Cut-off of the center engine of the S-II.</li>
<li>Change in mixture ratio caused by the operation of the PU valve.
The richer mixture reduces the thrust slightly.</li>
<li>Outboard engine cut-off of the S-II at a peak of approximately 2.7g.</li>
<li>S-IVB stage ignition. Note again the reduced angle of the graph caused by
the thrust being cut by a fifth.</li>
<li>With the cut-off of the S-IVB's first burn, the vehicle is in orbit with
zero acceleration.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>


<h3><a name="iudesc"></a>Instrument Unit description</h3>
<blockquote>
Atop the S-IVB stage, a ring 1 meter high and the same diameter as
the stage, called the IU (Instrument Unit), carries the guidance and control electronics
for the Saturn V. Particularly important among these are the LVDC (Launch Vehicle Digital Computer)
and the inertial platform, the ST-124, which has to be aligned to the intended trajectory before launch.
The angle between north and the ground track of the vehicle's flight path is called the flight azimuth.
For this launch, it is to be 72.067&deg; or east north east.
The gyroscopically stabilized platform at the heart of the ST-124 is aligned with the intended
azimuth just prior to launch by rotating the X stable member with reference to a theodolite mounted
some distance away from the launch pad. There is a small window in the skin of the
Instrument Unit for this purpose.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="j2desc"></a>J-2 description</h3>
<blockquote>
The S-II stage carries five J-2 uprated engines which burn LH<sub>2</sub>
and LOX to produce up to 230,000 pounds [1,020 kN] thrust each.
They are capable of being restarted in flight but this feature is only implemented in the
engine used in the S-IVB.
Each engine weighs about 3,500 pounds [1,600 kg], is about 3.8 meters long and 2 meters wide
at the base of the engine bell.
<p>
<a href="pics/j-2_big.gif" target="new"><img src="pics/j-2_small.jpg" width=654 height=476
alt="Labelled diagram of J-2 engine"></a>
<p>
The thrust chamber and bell of each engine is fabricated from stainless steel tubes brazed
together in a single unit. Supercold LH<sub>2</sub> is pumped through these tubes to cool
the thrust chamber and simultaneously prewarm the fuel.
The engine carries two separate turbopumps, both powered in turn by the exhaust from a
gas generator which burns the stage's main propellants.
The hot gas exhaust is fed from the gas generator, first to the fuel turbopump,
then to the LOX turbopump before being routed to a heat exchanger and finally into the engine bell.
The fuel and LOX outputs of both turbopumps are fed, via main control valves,
to the thrust chamber injector via the LOX dome. Unlike the solid steel injector
of the F-1, the J-2 injector is fabricated from layers of stainless steel mesh sintered
into a single porous unit.
A solid LOX injector behind this carries 614 posts which pass LOX through the injector and into
the combustion chamber.
Each post has a concentric fuel orifice around it and these orifices are attached to the porous injector.
The fuel delivery is arranged to ensure that about 5 percent seeps through the
injector face to cool it, the rest passing through the annular orifices.]<p>
[The ASI (Augmented Spark Igniter), fed with propellant and mounted to the injector face,
provides a flame to initiate full combustion. Valves are provided to bleed propellant through
the supply system well before ignition to chill all components to their operating
temperatures otherwise gas would be formed which would interfere with the engine's
use of propellant as a lubricant in the turbopump bearings.
A tank of gaseous helium is fabricated within a larger tank of gaseous hydrogen.
This is the Start Tank. The helium provides control pressure for the engine's valves
while the hydrogen spins up the turbopumps before the gas generator is ignited.
A PU (Propellant Utilization) valve on the output of the LOX turbopump can open to reduce the LOX flow rate.
This adjusts engine thrust down to 890 kN (200,000 pounds) during flight to optimize engine performance.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="j2start"></a>J-2 start</h3>
<blockquote>
To start the J-2 engine, spark plugs in the ASI and gas generator
are energized. The Helium Control and Ignition Phase valves are actuated.
Helium pressure closes the Propellant Bleed valves, it purges the LOX dome and other parts of the engine.
The Main Fuel valve and the ASI Oxidizer valves are opened.
Flame from the ASI enters the thrust chamber while fuel begins to circulate through
its walls under pressure from the fuel tank. After a delay to allow the thrust chamber
walls to become conditioned to the chill of the fuel, the Start Tank is discharged through
the turbines to spin them up. This delay depends on the role of the engine.
A one second delay is used for the S-II engines. Half a second later,
the Mainstage Control Solenoid begins the major sequence of the engine start.
It opens the control valve of the gas generator where combustion begins and the exhaust
supplies power for the turbopumps.
The Main Oxidizer valve is opened 14&deg; allowing LOX to begin burning with the fuel
which has been circulating through the chamber walls. A valve which has been allowing
the gas generator exhaust to bypass the LOX turbopump is closed allowing its turbine
to build up to full speed. Finally, the pressure holding the Main Fuel valve at 14&deg;
is allowed to bleed away and the valve gradually opens, building the engine up to its rated thrust.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="les"></a>Launch Escape System</h3>
<blockquote>
The LES consists of the Launch Escape Tower (LET) and the Boost Protective Cover (BPC).
The entire system is 33 feet [10 m] tall and weighs 9,025 pounds [4,094 kg].
The BPC completely covers the Command Module (CM) to protect it from aerodynamic heating during
ascent, and in case of an abort, from the LET motor exhaust.
The BPC also covers up three of the CMs five windows, leaving uncovered only the the commanders
window on the left and the center window, built into the hatch.
The LET contains three solid-fuel rocket motors.  The main motor generates 147,000 pounds [654 kN]
of thrust for 8 seconds.  It has the job of pulling the CM to safety in case of an
abort.  The pitch control motor produces 2,400 pounds [10.7 kN] of thrust for about a half second.
During a pad or low altitude abort, it has the job of tilting the CM/LES towards the Atlantic
to make sure the CM lands in the water, far from the launch pad.
The last motor, the 31,500 pounds [140 kN] thrust tower jettison motor, pulls the complete LES
away from CM once the LES is no longer needed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The LES also includes
two canards (small airfoils) which are built into the top of the LET.  A few seconds after the main
motor burns out, they deploy to turn the CM around to the proper parachute deployment attitude.
At the very top of the LET is a small nose cone which contains the Q-ball.
The Q-ball provides the crew and Mission Control with information about dynamic pressure and alfa
(the angle between the flight path and where the vehicle is pointing, an indication of
lateral (sideways) aerodynamic loads).
The LES also contains two controllers that sequence it through both a normal flight and its
three abort modes.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="mccburn"></a>Mid course correction</h3>
<blockquote>
The Mission control people kept a careful watch over the trajectory
(flight path) of the Apollo spacecraft. If the spacecraft started to get
too far off course, either because of errors in the original trajectory,
uncoupled thruster firing, or venting, they would compute how much and
in much direction to change the velocity of the spacecraft in order to
get it back on course. They would then compute a <a href="info.html#burn">burn</a>
that the astronauts would perform to make this change. Because these burns
were quite small, there was usually no hurry to perform them (non time
critical). However, because they needed to be done very accurately, the
process of preparing and executing a burn required a fair bit of time.
Therefore the mission planners build a total of seven midcourse correction
opportunities into the flight plan, four on the way to the moon and three
on the way home.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="missions"></a>The Apollo mission alphabet: &quot;A&quot; to &quot;J&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
Owen Maynard, a Canadian engineer who went to work for NASA in 1959, developed an
ingeniously simple scheme to maintain an overview of the very complicated mission
scheduling process.  He assigned each mission type a letter from &quot;A&quot; for a CM
only unmanned flight,
to &quot;G&quot; for a lunar landing.
Later an &quot;H&quot; was added for a precise lunar landing with local exploration,
and  &quot;J&quot; for a rover equipped advanced mission.
Since each mission type was based on the results from previous mission types,
they had to be flown in alphabetical order.
This allowed everyone to speak of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; missions for example,
instead of having to specify exactly what a given mission would be doing.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="padabort"></a>The most vulnerable launch phase</h3>
<blockquote>
The Saturn V is at its most vulnerable during the roughly ten seconds between release
of the hold-down mechanisms and the clearing of the tower.
During this phase, any one of a number of failures which could easily be dealt with later in
the flight, loss of a F-1 for example, would cause the LV either to swing into the tower or
fall back onto the pad.
Either of these events would result in the breakup
of the LV and the uncontrolled release of 4,500,000 pounds [2,000,000 kg] of highly combustible
propellant.
The resulting fire ball would release as much energy as a small atom bomb.
(The explosive violence would, however, be much less since the energy would be released over
several seconds instead of almost instantaneously.)
<p>
Because the launcher is so vulnerable to the loss of an engine during this phase,
the automatic shutdown mechanism, built into each engine, is inhibited until 14 seconds after
liftoff.  This mechanism is designed to shut down an engine if it's not producing enough thrust.
During most of the flight of the S-IC, losing an engine means only a reduction in performance.
However, letting a failing engine continue to run risks an uncontained failure
or fire that could endanger other engines or vital parts of the launcher.
However, since shutting down the engine during the first part of the flight would result
in the catastrophic loss of the LV, it makes more sense to let the engine run.
In the best case, the engine is running perfectly and the shut-down signal is erroneous
(this has happened on the space shuttle).
Even if the engine is failing, there is a chance that it will continue to produce sufficient
thrust long enough to bring the LV through the vulnerable phase, at which time the engine
can be safely shut down.
<p>
This phase also places the greatest demands on the <a href="info.html#les">LES</a>.
Not only is there a maximum of
propellant feeding the fire-ball, but the nearness to the ground concentrates
the blast upwards, towards the CM.  During this phase, the CM also has little or no upwards
or downrange velocity.  The LET will have to not only rapidly accelerate the CM away from
the fire-ball, but will have to send it high enough (4,000 ft [1,200 m]) to be able to deploy
its parachutes and far enough down range (over a mile [about 2 km]) to allow it to land in the
Atlantic, well clear of any flying debris.
The LET was sized for this job.
The LET is capable of accelerating the CM at about 7g.  At that rate it would be up to
100 km/h in well under half a second and could do the standing quarter mile in about 3.5 seconds,
leaving even a top fuel dragster behind.
Although this phase entails more risk to the LV than the rest of the launch, the LES
is designed to bring the astronauts through safely.
<p>
Shortly after clearing the tower, this phase is over.  The LV will have already burned off
enough propellant to allow it to keep climbing even if an engine fails.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="perilune"></a>Perilune and Pericynthion</h3>
<blockquote>
Both of these terms are often used interchangeably to describe
the low point of a lunar orbit. Some experts say that perilune should only
be used if the spacecraft actually started from the Moon. Other experts
say the pericynthion should be used to describe the closest approach to
the Moon of a spacecraft that's flying past the Moon, but not in lunar
orbit.
However, in the context of an Apollo mission, the altitude at pericynthion
(and apocynthion, the high point of a lunar orbit) is always relative to the
lunar radius at the landing site.
Starting with Apollo 14, the astronauts would spend an extended time, including a
sleep period, in an orbit with a pericynthion of less than 10 nm [20 km].
Their restful sleep depended more on adequate ground clearance than height above an
abstract mean lunar radius.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="pogo"></a>Pogo</h3>
<blockquote>
All structures, from little tuning forks to large rockets,
tend to vibrate at certain so called resonance frequencies. If the rocket
is compressed, say by the firing of its engines, then it will start to
vibrate just like a big tuning fork. Usually this vibration will be quickly
damped out by friction or the sloshing of the propellants. However,
this sloshing can have an effect on the thrust of the engines by changing
the pressure of the propellants entering the engines. Rocket engines also
have certain resonance frequencies where they are particularly susceptible
to changes in propellant pressure. If one of these engine frequencies matches
the resonance frequency of the rocket, then a positive feed back loop can
be set up. The vibration of the rocket body then changes the engine thrust
which increase the vibration of the rocket. Although these vibrations start
out small, they can become large enough to destroy the rocket. This is
called coupled structure-propulsion instability. However, since the vigorous
up and down motion of a rocket suffering from this problem reminded the
rocket scientists of the motion of children hopping around on their
<a href="info.html#pogostick">Pogo Sticks</a>, they started to call it pogo.
Part of what gave rocket science its much deserved reputation is the need
to avoid this problem.
</blockquote>

<h3><a NAME="pogostick"></a>Pogo Stick</h3>
<blockquote>
A children's toy popular at the dawn of the space age. It consisted
of a tube about a meter and a half long with two footrests sticking out
at the bottom and a plunger coming out of the bottom. The plunger was connected
to the tube by a strong spring. To use the stick, one held it tightly near
the top, stepped on to the two footrests and started to move up and down.
This would compress the spring which in turn push the user back up. With
a little practice, one could jump up off the ground and even move over
the ground quite quickly by pointing the stick in the direction one wanted
to go.
</blockquote>

<h3><a NAME="residuals"></a>Residuals</h3>
<blockquote>
Not only were burns very carefully done, but also very carefully
monitored to make sure that exactly the right velocity change had been made
in exactly the right direction. This was done by measuring the change in
velocity of the spacecraft during the burn along all three of the axes
of the current coordinate system. The residuals are the differences between
the actual and the expected change in velocity along each of the axes.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="sicdesc"></a>S-IC description</h3>
<blockquote>
Of the 110.6 meter height of the entire Apollo 15/Saturn V stack, 42.1
meters comprise the S-IC first stage. Five F-1 engines, clustered at the bottom of the stage,
provide 7,610,000 pounds  [33,800 kN] of thrust. The propellants used are RP-1
(Rocket Propellant one or highly refined kerosene) as the fuel and LOX as the oxidizer.
The lower of two tanks is filled with 810,000 liters of RP-1 at T-13 hours with a final
topping up occurring at T minus 1 hour. At nine hours before launch, the larger upper tank
has nitrogen gas pumped through it to purge it of air and water vapor contaminants.
Six and a half hours before launch, it is precooled to prepare it for the loading of
1.3 million liters of LOX at a temperature of -183&deg; C. Initially, the LOX is fed
at a slow rate of 95 liters per second until the tank is sufficiently chilled to retain
the liquid up to 6.5% full, then the tank is filled to 98% at a rate of 630 liters per second,
a process lasting over 45 minutes. The slow fill rate is reestablished until the tank is full
at about 4 hours 55 minutes before launch. From then on, until three minutes before launch,
the level is replenished as the volatile LOX boils off. Both of the first stage tanks are then
pressurized prior to launch using helium; the fuel tank at T-96 seconds, the LOX tank at T-72 seconds.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="sicsep"></a>S-IC/S-II separation</h3>
<blockquote>
The simplest way to separate two stages of a launcher is the "fire in the hole" method.
Explosive devices sever the physical connections between the two stages and then the
upper stage engine(s) is simply ignited, literally blasting the two stages apart.
This method is widely used, notably by the ascent stage of the LM when it separates from
the descent stage.
However, NASA decided that a man-rated launcher of the size and complexity of a Saturn V,
needed a gentler, more predicable method, even if it was more complicated and somewhat less
efficient.
They decided on a multi-step, two-plane separation, that starts before S-IC cut-off
and doesn't finish until well after the S-II ignites.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To keep vehicle motion to a minimum during the separation, the first step is to stop
the pitch program which has been slowly
(about 0.5 &deg;/s) lowering the LVs nose towards the horizon.
Then the remaining F-1 engines are shut down, leaving some 34 metric tons of propellant still
unburned, enough for over 2 seconds of operation.
However, trying to run the tanks dry would result in at best, a couple of seconds of very
erratic engine operations, followed by an uncontrolled cut-off.
This would result in undesirable vehicle motion at a time when neither the first stage
nor the second stage engines could be used to damp them out.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As soon as the S-IC thrust has dropped off far enough, about 0.7 seconds after cut-off,
the first-plane of separation is performed when explosive devices sever
all connections between the S-IC and the interstage ring which joins the S-IC to the S-II.
This ring, which surrounds the J-2 engines at the base of the S-II, is nine
meters high and has only one meter of clearance between itself and the outboard J-2 engines.
Leaving the ring attached to the S-II stage ensures that even if the S-IC starts to rotate
during separation, it can't damage the J-2 engines.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since both parts of the LV are now in free fall, the first stage won't simply fall away.
In fact, the propellant left in the still hot F-1 engines will continue to produce
a residual thrust for several seconds.
This thrust combined with the small, but still
noticeable drag, will tend to hold the two stages together.
To overcome this, simultaneously with the S-IC separation, (about 0.7 seconds after
cut-off) eight small
solid-fuel retro-rockets built into the base of the S-IC are ignited.
These motors, each producing an average thrust of 340 kN for 0.54 seconds, are enough to
overcome the approximately 700 kN residual thrust of the outboard F-1 engines, and
decelerate the now 166 metric ton S-IC by about 12 m/s<sup>2</sup>, or 1.2g.
When they burn out, they will have slowed the S-IC by about 6.5 m/s and have already achieved
a separation of almost two meters.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile, 0.6 seconds after S-IC cut-off, the S-II takes the first step towards starting
its five J-2 engines.
Four solid-fuel ullage-motors attached to the interstage ring are ignited.
These motors, each producing 100 kN of thrust for 3.7 seconds, accelerate
the upper stages at 0.6 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
Although modest, this will further help to separate the two stages.
However, as the name implies, they mainly serve as ullage motors.
The thrust of the S-IC had compressed the S-II stage like a giant spring.
When this thrust stops, the stage rebounds, causing quite a bit of sloshing of the propellants.
Although the tanks are almost full, there is a small gas bubble, or ullage at the top of
the tanks that is needed to keep the propellants under pressure.
To ensure the the J-2 engines will start cleanly, its necessary to keep
this bubble away from the engine inlets.
The acceleration provided by the ullage motors allows the buoyancy of the bubble to lift the
bubble towards the top of the tank and keep it there until
the J-2 engines start producing thrust.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, 1.4 seconds after S-IC cut-off and 0.7 seconds after S-IC separation,
the stages are far enough apart to begin the J-2 engine start sequence without
risking damage from the blow back of gases or debris from the top of the S-IC stage.
(A camera on top of the S-IC stage, which films the separation, and a telemetry package
also need to be protected from the J-2 exhaust.)
When the J-2 engines are actually ignited, about 1.7 seconds after separation,
the two stages will be about 12 meters apart.
By the time their thrust starts to rapidly build up, about 3 seconds after separation, the
S-IC will have already dropped back over 20 meters.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The final step of the separation, the second-plane, occurs 30 seconds after the first-plane
and 30.7 seconds after S-IC cut-off.
The J-2 engines have now had enough time to start running smoothly,
to complete the first mixture ration change, and to damp out
any undesirable motion caused by the separation or J-2 engine ignition.
Explosive devices can now safely sever the connections between the 11,500 pounds
[5,000 kg] ring and the S-II stage.
The thrust of the engines then quickly and smoothly pushes the rest of the launcher
away from the ring.
This process is well documented in a short film sequence that shows the ring falling away and
then starting to tumble and glow when it's hit by the J-2 exhaust.
This film was used as part of the title sequence of the film <i>Apollo 13</i>.
Although it looks like the ring is falling away, despite being slowed somewhat by the
J-2 exhaust, it is continuing to climb and move down range at over 2,300 m/s.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The entire two-plane separation process, from S-IC cut-off to ring separation,
lasting a total of 30.7 seconds, is now complete.

<h3><a name="siidesc"></a>S-II description</h3>
<blockquote>
The second, or S-II, stage of Apollo 15's Saturn V vehicle
is 24.8 meters tall and is powered by the combustion of LH<sub>2</sub> (liquid hydrogen)
and LOX in a cluster of five J-2 rocket motors which generate a total thrust of
1.15 million pounds [5,115 kN]. A million liters of LH<sub>2</sub>, cooled to -253&deg;C to get
it into a liquid state, is loaded into the large, upper tank of the stage while 331,000 liters of LOX
is loaded into the smaller, squat tank below. These tanks share a single insulated structure with only
an insulated, common bulkhead between them. With both propellants being so cold - LH<sub>2</sub>
is only 20 degrees above absolute zero - the tanks must be prepared and chilled down before they can be filled.
<p>
Air and water vapor is purged from the tanks by repeated pressurization and venting with helium.
Helium is used because nitrogen would freeze in the presence of liquid hydrogen.
Once clear of contaminants, the tanks are cooled to accept the propellants by first passing cold gas
through the system then feeding propellant at a slow rate and allowing it to boil off, taking heat with it.
Seven hours before launch, LOX is fed at 31.5 liters per second until it is 5% full,
then the fill rate goes to 315 liters per second to take the tank to 96% full.
This takes about 25 minutes and then the tank is topped up at 63 liters per second.
Five hours before launch and after purging and cooling, LH<sub>2</sub> enters at 63 liters per second,
further cooling its tank so that propellant begins to remain liquid and rise in level
in a process similar to that for the LOX tanks. Once the level of liquid propellant reaches 5 percent,
the fill rate is increased to 630 liters per second until the tank is 98 percent full,
when the fill rate reduces again to 63 liters per second to top off the tanks load.
To compensate for loss due to boil-off, both tanks are replenished until about three minutes before
launch when the tanks are pressurized. Up to the launch, pressurizing helium gas is supplied from the ground.
After launch, the boil-off of the propellants is enough to maintain pressure until
the engines are ignited 2 minutes and 40 seconds into the flight.

<h3><a name="siisep"></a>S-II/S-IVB separation</h3>
<blockquote>
The stages are connected by a truncated cone shaped interstage skirt which
encloses the S-IVBs single J-2 engine.
Unlike the S-IC separation, the S-II separates from the S-IVB at a single plane, the junction of
the top of this cone and the base of the S-IVB.
After extensive consideration, NASA concluded that among other factors, the larger clearance
between the single J-2 engine and the top rim of the skirt, and the more benign conditions
at the time of separation made a two plane separation unnecessary.
Any residual risk would be more than compensated for by having a simpler separation process.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With this one exception, the S-II separation is very similar to the S-IC
separation.
Although LV maneuvering doesn't appear to be explicitly stopped during the staging, vehicle
rotation rates are very low anyway, and the S-IVB is kept locked in its center position until
it is well clear of the interstage.
To avoid erratic engine operation and undesirable vehicle motion,
the S-IIs four outboard J-2 engines were supposed to be cut-off by a low propellant level signal.
All S-IIs from AS-504 on included a 1.5 second delay from LOX depletion signal to
engine cut-off in order to increase propellant utilization.
However, AS-509 also included a simplified propellant utilization (PU) system which resulted
in a higher than expected LOX flow rate before cut-off.
The premature depletion of the LOX supply caused a sharp drop in engine
thrust, starting 0.7 seconds before cut-off, and 0.2 seconds of erratic thrust levels at
cut-off.  However, the response of the vehicle to this was nominal and posed no problems to the
separation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
After the S-II thrust has decayed almost completely, about one second after S-II cut-off,
explosive devices sever all connections between the interstage skirt and the base of the
S-IVB.
At the same time, four retro-rockets, built into the interstage, are ignited
to push the S-II away from the S-IVB.
(The following assumes that the retro rockets and ullage rockets used on AS-509 are the same
ones used on AS-503.  However, it is likely that smaller motors were used.)
These motors, each producing an average of 155 kN of thrust for 1.52 seconds, are enough to
decelerate the now 41 metric ton S-II by about 15 m/s<sup>2</sup>, or 1.5g.
It takes about a second for the S-IVB J-2 engine to emerge from the 5.8 meter
high interstage skirt.
When the retro-rockets burn out, they will have slowed the S-II by about 23 m/s and have
already achieved a separation of over 12 meters from skirt top to engine bell.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile, 0.9 seconds after S-II cut-off, the S-IVB takes the first step towards starting
its J-2 engine.
Two solid-fuel ullage-motors, attached to the base of the S-IVB, are ignited.
These motors, each producing 15 kN of thrust for 3.8 seconds, accelerate
the 170 ton upper stages at 0.18 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
This is adequate to ensure a smooth startup of the J-2 engine.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Just 0.1 seconds after separation, the J-2 receives it's start command.
By the time it actually ignites, 3.3 seconds later, the two stages will be more than 50 meters
apart.

<h3><a name="sivbdesc"></a>S-IVB description</h3>
<blockquote>
The third stage of the Saturn V, called the S-IVB for <a href="info.html#sivbname">historical</a>
reasons, could be described as a smaller version of the S-II stage in that it also consists of a
single tank structure with a common bulkhead between the LH<sub>2</sub> and LOX compartments.
These propellants, which are stored at the same supercold temperatures as for the S-II,
are burned in a single J-2 engine.
The stage is 58.6 [17.9 m] ft high and 21.7 feet [6.6 m] in diameter with a dry weight of
25,030 pounds [11,350 kg] and a lift off weight of 260,740 pounds [118,270 kg].
Its J-2 engine has a rated thrust of 230,000 pounds [1,020 kN].
The engine's capability for restarting is utilized for the boost out of Earth orbit to the Moon.
The construction of the S-IVB's propellant tank differs from the S-II stage by having the insulation
on the inside of the tank's metal skin, a detail which made manufacture easier by not having to
develop a bonding system which had to work at only 20 degrees above absolute zero.
With the insulation between it and the propellant, it would be substantially warmer.
About 8 hours before launch, the cryogenic systems of the S-IVB stage are purged,
including the engine feeds and pump cavities. At T minus seven and a half hours,
the LOX tank is precooled by pumping LOX onboard at 31.5 liters per second and allowing
its conversion to a gas to take away heat from the tank. When enough liquid remains to fill
the tank to 5%, the fill rate goes to 63 liters per second, the fast fill rate, until the tank
is 98% full. Finally the tank's total capacity of 92,350 liters is reached at a slow fill rate of up
to 19 liters per second, and after that, replenished at a rate of up to 2 liters per second.
The LOX tank filling takes about 25 minutes. Filling of the 253,200 liters of LH<sub>2</sub>
follows a similar process beginning 4 hours and 11 minutes before launch.
Tank precooling and filling to 5% is achieved with a fill rate of 31.5 liters per second,
before the fast filling of the tank at 190 liters per second takes the tank's quantity to
98% three and a half hours before launch.
The slow rate of fill is reestablished to top off the tank and keep it replenished.
LH<sub>2</sub> tank pressurization is maintained, during initial flight,
by the boil-off of the fuel, then later with helium from a collection of
spheres mounted on the exterior of the thrust structure at the base of the stage.
The LOX tank is pressurized from heated helium fed from cold storage tanks within the LH<sub>2</sub> tank.

<h3><a NAME="sivbname"></a>How the S-IVB got its name</h3>
<blockquote>
The S-IVB can trace its lineage back to the S-IV, designed in 1960 as the fourth
stage of the enormous C-4 launcher.  The S-IV started out having four, later six engines.
When the C-4 was dropped in favor of the three stage C-5 (later renamed Saturn V), the S-IV
was chosen as its third stage.  It was heavily modified, with one J-2 engine
replacing the six original engines.  However, the name was only changed from
S-IV to S-IVB.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although it wasn't supposed to be needed until after the first two stages of the C-5
were flight tested, when NASA needed a 2nd stage for the S-1B launcher, which was built
before the C-5, they decided to use the S-IVB.
So the stage that was supposed to be built and flown last, was built and flown first.
Conceived as a fourth stage, the S-IVB first flew as a second stage, before achieving
fame as a third stage.
This and much more was found in "Stages to Saturn" by Roger E. Bilstein.
