<div><b>003:06:00 Mitchell:</b> Houston, how's the television look to you now? Anything I can do to the picture?</div>

<div class="pao">That's the launch vehicle digital computer, the LVDC. We're at 3 hours, 9 minutes now into the flight.</div>

<div><b>003:10:18 Fullerton:</b> We're - we're picking out things pretty well here. If you have anything for - the rest of the country, you might go ahead and talk if it won't interfere with the operation there.</div>
<div><b>003:10:35 Mitchell:</b> Okay, I'll chat for a minute. The <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> is surrounded here by typical thousands, or millions of particles that came out when we separated. They look like little winking stars, floating around in a very random pattern. The sunlight is shining very strongly off the top of the lunar module as we drift into it. Stu's doing an excellent job of sliding in here very slowly. As you can see that - our approach speed is a few tenths of a foot per second, probably. And the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> is starting to get very large in our field of view; starting to cover the window, out my plus-X window. And the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> and the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> are boresighted right out our X-axis. We can see all of the - orange, yellow - thermal protection around the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>. The parts that are black, silver, and white; the colors stand out very nicely. And I can look across - across Stuart.</div>

<div><b>003:25:20 Roosa:</b> Okay, Houston; 14. I can look in the drogue and I can see three marks 120 degrees apart, like the capture latches are scratching the drogue. They're about - I don't know - inch and a half long going into the hole in the drogue about - spaced about 120. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>003:25:46 Fullerton:</b> Roger. [Long pause]</div>
<div><img src="pics/p_and_d.gif"></div>
<div class="comment">During docking, the head of the probe slides through the hole at the bottom of the drogue.  The three latches on the head then lock in the extended position to keep the probe from sliding back out.  This is called a soft dock.  The probe is then retracted, pulling the two spacecraft together. The 12 docking latches then lock on to the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a>'s docking collar to achieve a hard dock. However the latches on the probe head were not working correctly which prevented a soft dock.</div>
<div><b>003:26:19 Fullerton:</b> 14, Houston. Can you describe the scratches? Are they sharp scratches or rounded off? Over.</div>
<div><b>003:26:26 Roosa:</b> Well, I didn't really see that good. I can move back in, I guess. We can take a look at them. They look like fairly distinct - scratches coming into the hole, but - let's move up. We'll take another look.</div>

<div><b>003:30:37 Fullerton:</b> Yes, that's been discussed here. We think probably something is holding them out. One possibility is a sort of a shearpin that gets pulled off when the tower is jettisoned and - First look at it looks - We're thinking maybe that may not be - may not allow the capture latches to depress.

<div class="pao">Apollo Control, Houston, the pacing item would be the attitude control on the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a>. The battery power is the major constraining item on that, however it does allow us a fair amount of time, approximately 6 to 8 hours. Continuing to monitor the trouble shooting operation here at Mission Control, this is Apollo Control, Houston. We presently show Apollo 14 at an altitude of 10,643 nautical miles [19,711 km], and we're at a Ground Elapsed Time of 3 hours, 42 minutes.</div>
<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control Houston. 3 hours, 43 minutes into the flight. Trouble shooting continuing in Mission Control. To quickly repeat, we have been unable to latch with the lunar module. We have quite a while to consider an approach to this problem. The battery power on the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> is perhaps a major constraining item, allowing us perhaps 6 to 8 hours of time. However, if we're not able to extract the lunar module, of course the Lunar Landing Mission would not be possible. We're at 3 hours, 44 minutes continuing to monitor.</div>
<div><b>003:44:08 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 14, Houston.</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control, Houston at 3 hours, 53 minutes now into the flight. We presently show 14 at al altitude of 12,310 nautical miles [22,798 km] away from earth. To again go over our problem, the capture latches have not been working. One of the plans being considered here and will very probably be passed on to the crew is to retrack the probe and attempt to bypass the capture latches hoping to get the - to the docking latches. There are 12 docking latches and to successfully dock we would need 3 to work. If we are not able to extract the Lunar Module - I repeat our Lunar Landing Mission would not be possible. It is certainly a serious problem in terms of the mission itself, however, it is not that consideration in terms of crew safety at this time. We're at 3 hours, 54 minutes continuing to monitor. We show Apollo 14 at 12,481 nautical miles [23,115 km] away from Earth and this is Apollo Control, Houston.</div>
<div><b>003:58:49 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 14, Houston. I'd like you to try one thing. Take the Extend/Retract switch to Retract and tell us what the talkbacks read in Retract as you have on others before. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>003:59:10 Roosa:</b> Okay, Gordon. You want the switch in Retract and a read - readout of the talkback?</div>
<div><b>003:59:17 Fullerton:</b> That's affirmative; while the switch is in Retract.</div>
<div><b>003:59:21 Roosa:</b> Roger. It's in Retract now and the talkback is gray.</div>
<div><b>003:59:25 Fullerton:</b> Roger.</div>
<div><b>003:59:27 Flight controller:</b> Okay. That tells us right there that the capture latches are indeed cocked and that kind of says that there's something in there that's keeping us from releasing them when we go ahead and dock. And it says that we cannot fire bottle.</div>
<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control, Houston, 4 hours now into the flight. We in Mission Control continuing to trouble-shoot our docking problem. The discussions still underway, both in the Mission Control room operation floor proper and with the span or the backroom experts. The capture latch has not been working. It is a problem which can be considered and discussed and played with for awhile. The constraining item would be the attitude on the third stage, the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> and perhaps the most critical point there is the battery power and this approximate lifetime of some 6 to 8 hours. Again if we are not able to extract the Lunar Module the basic Lunar Landing Mission would not be possible and of course, an alteration - consideration of alternate missions would have to be made at that time. We're at 4 hours, 2 minutes into the flight. We show 14 at an altitude of 13,523 nautical miles [25,045 km]. This is Apollo Control, Houston.</div>

<div><b>004:37:26 Roosa:</b> Okay, I'll give you - try to give you the best. As I look at the probe - and then you all can figure out where the docking latches are from there; but as I look at the probe in the docking position, the prominent thing - are we have three scratches about - oh, maybe a couple of inches long, and they're really - well, the top one is about - essentially 12 o'clock, maybe 11:30, and then they're spaced, you know, equally around the ring, about 120 out. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>004:38:24 Roosa:</b> And there is one other scratch that I didn't see before, that I must have put on this last attempt. I noticed it as we backed out, and it - Well, there - there are a couple of other little ones, but the next prominent scratch is, oh, at about the 7 o'clock position. It starts at the hole and runs out for about 3 inches - maybe 4 inches.</div>
<div><b>004:38:33 Fullerton:</b> Roger.</div>
<div><b>004:38:34 Shepard:</b> Houston, all these scratches are radial, and they're right up at the very apex of the drogue.</div>
<div><b>004:38:40 Fullerton:</b> Roger. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>004:38:56 Cernan:</b> Hey, Stu. This is Gene-o. Do you read?</div>
<div><b>004:38:58 Roosa:</b> Yes, loud and clear.</div>
<div><b>004:39:02 Cernan:</b> Okay. We - we got one more idea down here - Before doing any hard suit work, and - let me throw it out at you, and you come back with your impressions. We're thinking of - of attempting to - to dock actually without the aid of the probe, which requires some pretty fine alinement. We're thinking that maybe you could go ahead and go through a normal plus-X and put the probe in the drogue, and while your holding a - This will help you with your alinement - and while you're holding a plus-X, go ahead and blow a bottle and try and retract the probe. Now, if the probe retracts, it should retract well out of your way, so that the - the actual docking latches, with any luck on the alinement, should mate. Now, if you get one latch, we feel we'll - we'll be fast and we can - we can get them all. There's one hooker. The configuration that we think you might be in - Electrically, there may be a series path broken which doesn't allow us, actually, to - to retract the probe through blowing one of those bottles. But we feel it sure is worth a chance or, worth a try before - before we do any hard suit work. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>004:40:37 Shepard:</b> All right, Gene-o. Let me see if we understand you on that. Your - your thought is to blow one of the bottles to retract the probe after we're alined up and just before contact - or wait until we contact, and then thrusting, and then retract the probe. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>004:41:00 Cernan:</b> Okay, Al. We're - we're thinking that actually, if you use the - Leave the probe extended until you actually contact, that - that any small, minute misalinement, at least in translation left, right, up, or down, will be taken out as the probe centers in the hole of the drogue. If you can keep a plus-X going at that time and then retract the probe, hopefully, your alinement will stay fairly close and - and we may pick up a couple of the docking latches. Now, as I said, we've got some reservations. We're not - we're not sure, actually, the probe is going to retract, so you might keep that in mind. But again, if it doesn't retract, we haven't lost a bottle, and if it does retract and you - you do get a docking latch, we've accomplished what we wanted to. [Long pause]</div>

<div class="comment">To get around the their soft dock problem, they decided to try directly for a hard dock. The plan was to use the probe to help line up the spacecraft, but then to retract it without achieving a soft dock. Instead of pulling the spacecraft together with the probe, they would push them together with the <a href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> thrusters.  With the proper alignment and a little luck, they should be able to achieve a hard dock. Although the plan seemed to work, it later looked like the successful hard dock had been preceded by a normal soft dock.</div>

Flight Director Milton Windler is coming on to relieve Flight Director Pete Frank. That handover will occur after <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> extraction. A short while ago, the Flight Director was asked when <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> extraction would occur. His response was, whenever the crew is ready. The crew is proceeding to extract the <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> in the normal manner at this time, and following <a href="acron.html#lm">LM</a> extraction, there will be a change of shift briefing in the large Auditorium in building 1 at the Manned Spacecraft News Center. A short while ago, also, Gene Cernan, who was on the CapCom console made the remark following the successful docking that in paraphrasing was something as follows, a similar remark that I guess that practice we had this morning in the crew quarters paid off. He was referring to a mass which was said for him and Stu Roosa in the crew quarters at Cape Kennedy this morning. Recapping the docking situation, the docking was tried a total of 6 times before the successful hard docking occurred at 4 hours, 56 minutes, 46 seconds. On the sixth attempt, the procedure was for the 14 crew to maneuver up to the lunar module using the probe to aline the vehicles properly, to bring the docking mechanism in proximity with the docking ring on the lunar module and at that time to attempt to retract the probe mechanism hoping that the docking latches would then come together, would be properly alined, and that the hard docking could occur. This is, in fact, what appeared to happen although it is not certain at this time whether or not the docking probe did in fact engage and latch as it normally would or whether the docking mechanism came together with the docking latches engaging merely by virtue by the fact that the probe mechanism was retraced. In a normal docking, the probe which is a</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 5 hours, 55 minutes. The crew now maneuvering into the proper position for the <a href="acron.html#aps">APS</a> evasive maneuver, in some of the conversation, you've heard reference to the fact that data from the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a>

<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div class="pao">The <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> moving into the proper position for the aps evasive maneuver. Our communications officer reported a drop out in data. They're checking to determine the cause of it. The concern mentioned previously about the controlling the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> for the aps evasive maneuver refer to the fact that a multiplexer apparently has failed in the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a>
instrument unit. The primary concern here is that in performing the maneuver, there are certain systems that flight controllers don't have as good a visibility into as they would prefer. However the fact that the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> responded to the yaw maneuver command properly indicates that the systems are responding as they should and the aps evasive maneuver using the auxiliary propulsion system on the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> will be performed as scheduled. This will be a 10 foot per second maneuver getting the separation distance between the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> and the Lunar Module, and will be supplemented by a propulsive locks dock maneuver. The locks dock maneuver is designed to reduce the probability of spacecraft recontact.</div>
<div><b>005:58:34 Roosa:</b> Well, Gordon, the maneuver looks like it's going well. She's sure maneuvering away from looking at us, and it's a beautiful sight.</div>
<div><b>005:58:43 Fullerton:</b> Roger, Stu. It sounds good to us. We had some question about command capability and it sounds like it's okay.</div>
<div><b>005:58:51 Roosa:</b> Oh, yes. She's going away from us.</div>
<div class="comment">Comm break.</div>
<div class="pao">Following the auxiliary propulsion system maneuver, and the propulsive venting of the liquid oxygen aboard the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a>, there will be a targeted burn determined, or targeted to impact the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> on the Lunar surface at approximately 53 degrees west and 20 degrees south, which is near the Apollo 12 landing site, and it is expected that this maneuver will be carried out as planned. You heard Stu Roosa on that last exchange report that the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a> was responding properly to command and appeared to be coming around in the proper attitude.</div>
<div><b>006:00:36 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 14, Houston. Would you give us Omni Delta?</div>
<div><b>006:00:48 Mitchell:</b> Okay, you have it, Houston.</div>

<div class="pao">This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 2 minutes, 18 seconds, a little less than 2 minutes away now from the scheduled auxiliary propulsion system evasive maneuver on the <a href="acron.html#sivb">S-IVB</a>. Capcom Gordon Fullerton advised the Apollo 14 crew that that maneuver would occur at 6 hours, 4 minutes, with the liquid oxygen dump scheduled to occur at 6 hours, 25 minutes, 20 seconds.</div>
<div><b>006:04:28 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 14, Houston. The evasive maneuver should be going now. How does it look?</div>
<div><b>006:04:33 Roosa:</b> Roger. We - we see the booster moving.</div>
<div><b>006:04:39 Fullerton:</b> Roger. [Long pause]</div>
<div><b>006:04:50 Fullerton:</b> Now the last thing you can do for us on this, because of our lack of determining the booster attitude, is, as it fades out of view - if you can determine if it is still looking stable. Over.</div>
<div><b>006:05:02 Roosa:</b> Okay. We can sure handle that, and you got some venting there, too, as you started that maneuver.</div>
<div><b>006:05:10 Fullerton:</b> Roger. That's normal. I was expecting it.</div>
<div><b>006:05:14 Roosa:</b> Okay.</div>
