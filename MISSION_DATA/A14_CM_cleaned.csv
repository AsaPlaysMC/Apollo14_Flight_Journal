000:38:30|LMP|That's affirm.
000:38:31|CMP|OPTICS ZERO to ZERO.
000:38:32|LMP|And if we torqued, we should realine the GDC -
000:38:36|CDR|Okay. Now - Yes, Just a minute. Go OPTICS ZERO after we get them down to a certain angle, right?
000:38:43|CMP|Yes, I'm going to try to do that. It's really not part of our operation, but you can't go wrong doing it.
000:38:49|LMP|I'm - I'm going to bring the purge on. We'll get a MASTER ALARM.
000:38:58|CDR|Okay. Ball 1 ATT set, IMU. Roll was about - 180. Fuel cell 2, okay. And the yaw is set about -that much and the pitch is way over at 220.

000:41:31|LMP|Yes. That's - -
000:41:32|CMP|I do, too. I have a hell of a job holding myself down for shooting the optics.
000:41:39|CDR|Yes. Boy, those stars are - -
000:41:41|LMP|Real good.
000:41:42|CDR|- - crystal clear.
000:41:43|LMP|Roger. It just has to be ORB RATE. Sixty-one percent.
000:41:50|CDR|And I got a real bright one we're aimed for right now.
000:41:53|CMP|Boy, they're not near as bright in that telescope as they are in the simulator.
000:41:56|CDR|Well, you're probably not adapted yet.
000:41:57|CMP|Yes. Yes. I got down here with these floodlights flaring out - -
000:42:00|CMP|Yes.
000:42:01|CMP|After I turned them out, I could see Gienah through it the second time around, so I was adapting. Okay. Looks like all I need to do is the - is to get out the stowage bag - -
000:42:14|CDR|Got a good horizon out here.
000:42:16|CMP|Dark?
000:42:17|CDR|Yes.
000:42:18|CMP|You can see it, huh?

000:42:24|LMP|No. No. I don't need anything else out of you right now, Stu.
000:42:28|CDR|Well, I'm seeing it ... I'm seeing airglow, Stu. I can see the stars on the other side of it.
000:42:32|CMP|Well, I tell you what. Why don't I get out those temporary stowage hags, and then I can get the cameras out at our convenience, if that's agreeable
000:42:40|CDR|I'm ready for it. You can hand me mine right now.
000:42:42|CMP|Weil, I've got to go down and get it first.
000:42:44|CDR|Okay. Yes. That's airglow I can see, because I can see the stars underneath it.
000:42:51|CMP|Man, that booster's something. Couldn't get over the ice. That was something when the ice came off.
000:42:54|LMP|Yes, that really was.
000:42:56|CMP|I expected more vibration.
000:42:57|CDR|I really did, too.
000:42:58|CMP|I was really -
000:42:59|CDR|Yes, I thought that was a real smooth ride. Real smooth. Okay. Let's keep pressing ahead here. Slowly but surely. How you doing, Ed?
000:43:15|LMP|Okay. Proceeding through my systems check.
000:43:20|CMP|I got a bag coming up your side there. Ocp! Hey, another one got away - the other two are up behind your head. Can you reach them?
000:43:27|LMP|Who, me?
000:43:28|CMP|Yes (laughter).
000:43:33|LMP|Yes, I'll get them.
000:43:34|CMP|Hey, good (laughter). Thank you, babe. Guess what I found in there.
000:43:39|CDR|Oh, those goddamn things are going to be all over the place. You were right what you said about Dell'Osso.
000:43:47|CMP|Yes? I was needling Gene. I knew they'd done that. I mean, I didn't know it but I sus - Right behind your head are two more of those bags, Al, if you could reach them.
000:43:56|CDR|Okay. I'll get them. We're probably going to be collecting those patches the rest of the flight.
000:44:02|LMP|Yes, they're going to be hiding everywhere.
000:44:07|CDR|Okay, Ed-babe. How about a temporary stowage bag?
000:44:11|LMP|All right. I'll take one.
000:44:12|CDR|And, Stu-babe. How about a temporary stowage bag?
000:44:14|CMP|I'll take one.

000:44:37|LMP|You beat your old record at insertion! (Laughter)
000:44:39|CDR|(Laughter) I know it. I was just kidding.
000:44:49|LMP|Okay.
000:44:51|CMP|And, in here, you'll have to make sure you get the bottom one snapped, which you have not had to do in the - -

000:44:57|CMP|- - in the CMS.
000:44:58|CDR|Yes. We've done at your insistence. At your insistence, we have done it, and it's now completed here.
000:45:05|CMP|Okay.
000:45:06|CDR|Okay.
000:45:07|LMP|Let's see. We're on 4-Bravo on the test meter, and it's reading 37.
000:45:18|CDR|Okay, now what?
000:45:21|LMP|Okay. I'm ready to do an ECS monitoring check. SUIT PRESSURE - DELTA-P is okay.
000:45:30|CDR|(Laughter) How are you doing down there, ...?
000:45:33|LMP|... O2 flow ...
000:45:34|CMP|Five balls. That's the way I wanted to start. The next thing on the agenda is that freaking decal up there. 32.5.
000:45:41|CDR|Okay. Well, we'll - -
000:45:43|CMP|We'll work on that one.
000:45:44|CDR|We'll get to that.
000:45:45|CMP|If I start hosing it out, you just say something.
000:45:49|CDR|I'll say something. Don't you worry. Don't you worry, babe.
000:45:53|CMP|There's another one.
000:45:54|LMP|Okay - -
000:45:55|CMP|Okay.
000:45:56|LMP|- - We're in the green on REPRESS package.
000:45:57|CDR|Well, we'll have plenty of them to give out. Yes. We ought to save them for all the hookers in Titusville (laughter).
000:46:04|LMP|Huh? He said we could either carry them gracefully or otherwise.
000:46:09|CDR|Yes. No. I'm going to give them to all the hookers in Titusville.
000:46:15|CMP|Let?s see. You might get out your bracket for the camera, if you're out of things to do, AI, and I'll be handling the camera, shortly.
000:46:21|CDR|Okay, Okeydokey.
000:46:25|SC|(Whistling)
000:46:30|CDR|I was going to reach for the G&C Dictionary (laughter).
000:46:44|CDR|Yes. We got to treat this with a little care because it might just come out of there like everything else does.
000:47:10|CDR|Stu?
000:47:11|CMP|Huh?
000:47:13|LMP|Can you - reach over there and unsnap one of those - unsnap one of those hose lines?
000:47:19|CMP|Yes. Yes, I certainly can.
000:47:20|CDR|Because we don't want to wipe out - Thank you. Thank you. That's the dimension I need.
000:47:54|CDR|Oh, Jesus. There's one in here, too. There must be one in every frigging volume - stowage that we have.
000:48:02|LMP|Probably.
000:48:03|CMP|I think there's going to be.
000:48:07|CDR|Yes, they knew. God damn, they knew we've got to get into all these things.
000:48:14|LMP|Okay.
000:48:16|CMP|Hey, Ed, let me give a presento.
000:48:18|LMP|Okay. Just 1 sec.
000:48:21|CDR|Doot doot dun.
000:48:24|CMP|Here's something - Okay. If you could take a camera. Here's something, you know, we never check in any of the bench checks - that was this 10-millimeter lens won't stay in the - in the cushion. It just floats right on out.
000:48:35|CDR|
000:48:36|CMP|Yes. Look at that camera.
000:48:44|LMP|Getting a little leverage here.
000:49:45|CMP|I'll - I'll drop your seatbands in just a second there.
000:49:48|CDR|Let her go, babe. Oocoh.
000:49:55|LMP|Okay. Okay. I'm down in the checklist to where -We?ve already done to GDC ALINE; we will unstow the sequence camera bracket and the ORDEAL. Have you mounted the ORDEAL box?
000:50:10|CDR|You haven't told me to, yet.
000:50:11|LMP|Okay, you can do that as soon as you get your sequence camera under hand there, while I start doing the secondary glycol loop check. SECONDARY -SECONDARY COOL LOOP pump, AC 1. And I heard it come on.
000:50:34|CMP|Just for on the tape, for DSE purposes, the 10-raillimeter lens and 75-millimeter lens will not stay in the cushion.
000:50:43|LMP|Okay. That's surprising. They were kind of fight before, weren't they?
000:50:49|CMP|Yes.
000:50:51|CDR|Okay. What's the last set here on this thing?
000:50:54|CMP|I guess we've got a gray tape. Don't we - -
000:50:55|LMP|What, you want it set on it, Al?

000:51:41|CMP|Son of a bitch! I missed that, and I could've been up there, too.
000:51:43|CDR|Well, put that thing up.
000:51:44|LMP|Oh, hurry. It's not too late.
000:51:45|CDR|Look right here. Look right through the hatch.
000:51:47|CMP|I can't get the - All I can see is darkness.
000:51:49|LMP|Well -
000:51:52|CDR|It's down that way; come up - -

000:51:56|CDR|You really ought to get it, babe. Beautiful. It is beautiful!
000:51:59|LMP|That is really great. Sun comes up like thunder.
001:20:57|CMP|But you know, you get down there, you're not adapted at all. And I'd been looking at the bright Sun; and then, I look out there. I couldn't see a thing in - in this damn thing.
001:21:07|LMP|Yes, you must admit we ... sinking feeling. Well, I was sure they were gone, because I swore I felt them go.
001:21:13|CDR|Okay. We're going to talk to the States, here, in a few minutes. What are we going to do, since we're ahead a little bit, what do we do - -
001:21:22|CMP|Let me get out - while he's - I'll get out checklist here, while you're - -
001:21:27|CDR|Kind of look ahead and see what's next.
001:21:30|CMP|Yes, Yes, we've got all the cameras up.
001:21:35|CDR|(Laughter) ... Do you want to use this place up here for them?
001:21:38|CMP|Yes, that'd be good for it.
001:21:39|CDR|Okay. As a matter of fact, those rascals aren't bad.
001:21:45|CMP|You know, those are really good work on those
001:21:48|CDR|Good workmanship, yes.
001:21:54|CMP|Shouldn't have that on the tape either.
001:21:55|CDR|What does that say down there? Rock of Gibraltar? Take a closer look at that.
001:22:05|CMP|You did do the SCS attitude reference check?
001:22:07|LMP|Yes, I got it written down.
001:22:09|CMP|Okay. Now, the next thing we got coming up is the docking probe; and then, we get a TLI pad; and then, we start into TLI PREP, 1 plus
001:22:18|LMP|Yes. I've got our TV camera running over here.
001:22:23|CMP|Do you have the - an image on the monitor?
001:22:25|LMP|Uh-huh. Got the corner of the world poking out there.
001:22:27|CMP|You want to put the monitor up here and can we -
001:22:43|CDR|... start to feel a little hungry.
001:22:46|LMP|I am, too.
001:22:47|CDR|I'm glad we decided to put those sandwiches in there.
001:22:49|CMP|Wonder what we got.
001:22:52|CDR|Well, after all, it is 5=25, Cape time.
001:22:57|CMP|I must admit I got a tinge of glumness there when they called that hold. I was really primed for 3:23.
001:23:05|LMP|Yes, I was, too. I agree.
001:23:07|CDR|I can't really blame them though.
001:23:10|CMP|No, they got a - You know, you get bit once, you -you can't afford to - There's a lot of water down there. Ought to be able to ... coming up here.

001:24:29|CMP|Look at that. Good picture.
001:24:32|LMP|Now, if you want to hold it, let me see if I can peak it up here. It drifted away from me is the reason I - f/44, brighten it up. Okay. I think f/44 is what I want.
001:24:51|CDR|Pretty good.
001:24:53|SC|(Cough)
001:24:58|CDR|... resolution, haven't we?

001:25:42|LMP|Okay. Let me have that a minute, Stu.
001:25:44|CDR|
001:25:45|CMP|The only thing cluttering it up are the backur patches.
001:25:47|CDR|
001:25:49|LMP|Hold the cabin just a second, Stu. Let me see if I can anchor this monitor any better.
001:25:53|CMP|Okay. Yes, it - it's set up on that Velcro. It -it should seat where you - -
001:25:57|LMP|Well, it seems to be. I keep kicking it off. Here, let me -

001:26:03|LMP|That's all I - that's all I need is a little more cord.

001:26:13|LMP|What's that?
001:26:15|CDR|There's more badges (laughter).
001:26:17|LMP|Okay, I got it.

001:26:33|CMP|He who laughs last.
001:26:36|CDR|Well I?m - even so, I'm hell of a lot happier that we're flying and looking at their patches, rather than the other way around.
001:26:44|CMP|Well, that's what I meant by laughing last (laughter).
001:26:51|CMP|Yes. It?s really a strange feeling. You know, sitting here looking out, it's hard to tell whether you're standing on your head, or - -
001:27:05|LMP|Yes, I'm just - I?m still just a bit disoriented.
001:27:08|CDR|Are you?
001:27:09|LMP|Well, I'm not when I look out the window, but I'm still - I'm a little bit disoriented in direction.
001:27:13|CDR|Well, I think the only aloof feeling you have is Just the fact that you're stuffy feeling in your head.
001:27:20|LMP|Yes.

001:27:54|CDR|Up is up, and down is down.
001:28:03|CDR|No sweat!
001:28:14|CMP|Sure am anxious to get this thing burning again.

002:02:44|LMP|Yes, a little bit earlier.
002:02:45|CMP|It's going to be earlier because sunset was a little early. We have three - three-quarters of an hour - 15 degrees ...
002:03:04|CDR|Did we really get off at 03? Is that about what it was?
002:03:07|LMP|Yes. See - It looks like they programed us for iO-minutes-late lift-off and that's what we have.
002:03:13|CDR|Exactly 40, huh?
002:03:14|LMP|Uh-huh.
002:03:15|CDR|Good show.

002:04:21|CDR|Uh-huh.
002:04:22|CMP|Sitting here, quiet. The visual's a little better.
002:05:16|CDR|This seems to be a light flashing by.

002:06:58|CMP|Now, I see something to do here.
002:07:00|LMP|Yes, I'm going to go back - and make sure we haven't missed a single thing.
002:07:06|CMP|I got the G&N Dictionary down here. All out, ready to read.
002:07:13|LMP|Let's just be sure we haven't missed anything cn the checklist.
002:07:22|CMP|Did they get us started on the ... on that LOS?
002:07:27|LMP|Yes.
002:07:29|CDR|Let's see. We want ... 20 degrees ... and we're making -
002:07:39|CMP|No, 10 degrees.
002:07:41|CDR|Yes. Yes, 10. And we're making 4 degrees a min-ute. So, it should change our AOS time - I mean our sunrise time to 2 and a half minutes ...
002:07:53|CMP|...
002:07:54|CDR|And it should be earlier. Sunset should be earlier and sunrise should be earlier. Well, what does that work out for sunrise?
002:08:05|CMP|02:19.
002:08:13|CDR|Okay. looking at our fuel pressure - I mean, o.xidizer pressure should stay at 36 - 35 , and fuel at 20.
002:08:32|LMP|Okay, Al, do you want to check your DAC and make sure its settings are it - on it like you want it, to get it done. T8 at 250th.
002:08:43|CDR|Okay. Let me check it for you. I've got a T8, and it,s focused at 7 feet. I've got a 250th.

002:09:07|CMP|Exactly.
002:09:08|LMP|Okay. I?m going to set up the Hasselblad then.
002:09:13|CMP|0*ay. We're 9 and a half minutes from time base 6.
002:09:18|LMP|Okay.
002:09:56|CDR|Yes, I'm glad you called that, Ed. It shows you what you can do. I had apparently knocked that thing to 24 frames per second.
002:10:01|LMP|Really?
002:10:02|CDR|Yes. It's now sitting at 12.
002:10:34|CDR|Okay. Let's, just for the hell of it, take some pictures of that - top of that booster anyway, huh?
002:10:48|LMP|Yes, I'm going to try to. You mean with the Las-selblad or what?
002:10:51|CMP|Yes, the Hasselblad.
002:10:52|CDR|Yes, with the Hasselblad. We're supposed to do -'t only you know, provided it locks anomalous to us but I_think we ought to just go ahead and take a few pictures - -
002:11:00|LMP|Yes 5 I think we ought to ? ?
002:11:01|CMP|0h, yes. I think we ought to take a couple as we come off. And then, when we roll and it comes ir he hatch window, I think yon ought to take couple out o. the hatch window.
002:11:11|CDR|Have you got a range sight on the camera?
002:11:13|LMP|No, not right now. Wouldn't hurt it we did --it we don't. ? ?
002:11:19|CMP|Yes, I get myself all strapped in now.
002:11:28|LMP|Okay. ASA 64.
002:11:41|CDR|Okay. Time base 6 for a start, and then, we?U have sunrise. And then, we'll do all those gi>d things. s
002:11:49|CMP|Then we'll get AOS from Carnarvon. We?ll ee- a GO for TLI, and we'll burn the son of a gun.
002:12:01|LMP|Beautiful.
002:12:10|CMP|Some ride.
002:12:12|CDR|... I have to get closer, ...
002:12:14|CMP|Some ride.
002:12:16|CMP|There was no doubt in your mind of lift-off. I was a little surprised at the level of the vibration prior to lift-off though. I?d been led to believe it was probably worse. Maybe they're strapping us in tighter nowadays.
002:12:32|CDR|I didn't have any trouble with communications or anything,
002:12:35|CMP|Oh, it was beautiful all the way. Boy, that BPC goes, doesn't it? That tower, son of a hitch moves out. I didn't even notice the switches being hard (laughter). I didn't figure I would.
002:12:56|CDR|(Yawn)
002:12:58|CMP|I didn't figure I would. Man, it was beautiful! All the checks right on the mark. Played her right like the SIM.... just like the simulator.
002:13:12|LMP|T guess, in order to make sure we don't screw that up, I guess I'd better pull that dark slide out right now. Right there.
002:13:23|CMP|... yet.
002:13:27|LMP|Yes, but I don't want to - be ready to take a picture and miss a picture because of it.
002:13:32|CDR|Anybody want any water?
002:13:34|CMP|Yes. I'll take a slug of water.
002:13:41|CDR|... a good place to leave that baby ...

002:13:48|CDR|Oh, about 5 minutes.
002:13:51|LMP|I?m getting kind of hungry. I'm going to have to watch my weight. I'm going to really slurp it up at the table tonight - -
002:14:01|CMP|... up ir. there.
002:14:11|CDR|Well, ... be back ...
002:14:21|CMP|Pretty tasty water.

002:15:22|CMP|Oh, I?ve got a little stuffiness in my head. I -
002:15:26|CDR|Yes.
002:15:27|CMP|You know, it sort of feels like you're - maybe when you're pulling 1 and a half or 2g?s with a - with a cold.
002:15:35|LMP|Yes,
002:15:36|CMP|It sort of feels just like it.
002:16:05|LMP|I can't help but feel I'm laying on my back.

076:36:48|CDR|Okay. New they're ... we locked.
076:37:02|CMP|Yes, because we got a sextant star check, as a matter of fact, so we do want the power or..

076:37:13|CDR|Okay. How do we stand on your burn card?
076:37:18|CMP|Okay. We just cycled the cryo fan. No, I don't think we have to ... do that. EMS DELTA-V check, we have done. Now, let me think here. Now, we -In 30 seconds, that's going to go through zero, the way I figure that. We got a bias at 0.016 per second. We're going to have it on 30 seconds. Looks like it's going to go tc 0.48.

077:02:52|LMP|Yes, it was about that, Fredo. It could be that I wasn't giving it enough delay time before I tried something else, when it was in the NARROW position But I thought I was, and I don't know what I did differently on the last attempt that did work than the previous attempts which didn't work.
077:03:11|CMP|Okay. We have a good GDC alinement. All right, we're going to maneuver, leader.

082:11:07|LMP|Let's start one Just to keep track. And set It on - We'll set it on the time from 180, Al.
082:11:18|CDR|Okay ...
082:11:22|LMP|Yes, 38:30. Set it on - set it on 15 minutes, or li minutes - 38.
082:11:32|CDR|Hey, wait a minute; we got the damn clock running at 14. How about that? Can you give me a mark on 15? ... It's beautiful.
082:11:41|LMP|Okay; 12:38 - Let?s see - Time is 38:30. So, if I take - -
082:11:56|CDR|It would be ...
082:11:59|LMP|Yes. Why don't you get it 14 if you got - get it at 30 seconds.
082:12:03|CDR|Okay.
082:12:14|CDR|Fourteen.
082:12:15|LMP|Stand by. You've got 15 seconds.
082:12:29|LMP|MARK.
082:12:31|CDR|Okay, we got GET running.
082:12:38|CMP|GET from the 180?
082:12:41|LMP|Yes.

082:13:51|CMP|Tsiolkovsky's coming up on this window.
082:13:53|LMP|Tsiolkovsky's coming up on that one?
082:13:55|CMP|Yes.
082:14:40|CDR|There's Mendeleev....
082:15:08|LMP|I want to get around here and get a burn report off.
082:15:29|LMP|56, 1 minute.
082:15:42|CDR|Minus 15 seconds.
082:15:44|LMP|Okay. That's where we?ve got it.
082:15:48|CDR|
082:15:56|CMP|... by number 1 zero-phase target.
082:16:01|CDR|Did you?
082:16:02|CMP|Yes.... you can see, bigger than shit.
082:16:04|CDR|Not zero-phase right now?
082:16:05|CMP|No, but - I mean that - -
082:16:06|LMP|
082:16:10|CMP|... say something to aCCommodate ...
082:16:24|LMP|Houston, Apollo 14.
082:16:34|CDR|Okay, Fredo. We had an extremely fine burn. The burn report as follows: burn time, 6 plus 11; residuals, 0.3 plus, 0, and 0; DELTA-V^ is minus 7 - -
083:40:32|CDR|Go ahead.
083:41:02|CDR|Yes.
083:41:16|LMP|Man, that was a sharp -dropoff.
083:41:24|CMP|About TEI ...
083:41:38|LMP|Okay. I have RECORD, FORWARD, LOW RIT BATE - LOW BIT RATE, and COMMAND RESET.
083:41:46|CMP|Did they start the tape, or did you have to?
083:41:48|LMP|We started it.
083:41:52|CMP|I'm supposed to do that....
083:42:02|CMP|That's a ...
083:42:23|LMP|Okay.
083:42:32|LMP|Okay. I've got it right here.
083:43:03|LMP|Okay. And we're lunar orbit ... Use normal lunar configuration. Here we go. PRIM; PRIM; HIGH; VOICE; PCM; RANGING; DOWNVOICE BACKUP, TAPE, OFF; DATA, NORMAL. VHF, off, off; VHF, RECEIVE ONLY, OFF; VHF RANGING, OFF; PCM/ANALOG; RECORD; FORWARD; NORMAL; NORMAL; LOW; OFF; POWER ...

083:44:44|LMP|Okay. It looks very good to me.
083:44:52|CDR|... normal lunar configuration.
083:44:54|LMP|Okay. I set normal lunar configuration. PURGE LINE HEATERS, on.
083:45:00|CDR|.. .
083:45:02|LMP|31?
083:45:03|CDR|... 32 ...
083:45:11|LMP|Yes.
083:45:12|CDR|Okay.... purge ... and we got ...
083:45:37|LMP|Okay. And what angles do I have? ... on OMNI C?
083:45:50|LMP|Okay. If anybody wants to use the Myrtle, we ought to use it before we get a - -
083:45:56|CDR|4*1
083:45:58|LMP|- - before the ... and we need to make this waste water dump on the backside....
083:46:22|LMP|I'd like (cough) - Let's see what our waste water tank shows. We've got 60 percent. Man, that's ...
083:46:35|LMP|Yes.
083:46:38|CMP|Well, I'm not going to do the sightings until just before the terminator - on the other side. We got the whole frontside pass, and we do want the - they wouldn't want any dump - dumping across the frontside, I don't think ...
083:46:49|LMP|No. No. Definitely not.
083:47:07|LMP|Well, they should keep their schedule on the hack-side, too.
083:47:32|LMP|Okay.
083:47:51|CMP|No - No, I - I'm making a fast pass on the garbage can, but a little high in trajectory.
083:49:22|LMP|We ... the pass ... the backside pass after this one.
083:49:31|CMP|Yes.
083:49:39|CDR|Okay....
083:49:54|CMP|No, what this is, is - we'll maneuver - we won't -Yes. We won't be torquing the vehicle to waste gas. This will just be a look at our landmark for a similar-type approach for tracking after SEP tomorrow, for the landing, and from the low altitude. Give me a hack at acquisition time. Even though on the actual tracking, you torque your spacecraft at 2 degrees per second, ... will become a problem. Okay. Here's the Hycon for the top - topo.
083:50:39|CDR|Right on Descartes.
083:50:50|CDR|If you leave it up ... Descartes again, huh? Wait a minute.
083:50:56|CMP|No. You go to sleep after that one.
083:50:59|CDR|How are you supposed to configure the camera here? Okay. Your trigger's here and you actually photograph it there. And - ... eat and go to sleep. You ...
083:51:32|LMP|Yes. That's ... while we're waiting.
083:51:38|CDR|.. .
083:51:41|LMP|I just want to see the ...
083:51:43|CDR|Yes .. .
083:51:44|CMP|About 100 hours, we wake up. Somewhere in that time frame.
083:51:48|LMP|See what Stu's doing. See what kind of conflict we're really going to have in - getting dressed and that sort of thing.
083:51:54|CDR|We actually - rest period officially ends at 99-30. The eat period - ... 20 ...
083:52:24|LMP|Just a minute.
083:52:27|CDR|That was a bit vague at that point.
083:52:29|LMP|Yes.
083:52:42|CDR|And we got the IM transmitter lights ... out.
083:52:59|CDR|P00 update. And - right here might give you some trouble.... power ...
083:53:13|LMP|Roger. Getting into ... now. Tried to look for -
083:53:33|CDR|Okay. Let's see.
083:53:47|CDR|101:50 ... in the IM.
083:53:53|LMP|Time we start activation, huh? 101:50. That's 18 hours frcm now. Not very long.
083:54:25||CDR
083:54:26|LMP|
083:54:27|CDR|Pitch - pitch is supposed to be out, and yaw is supposed to be in.... start ... Get those babies all ho ok ed up....
083:55:02|LMP|Al, what you looking for? Okay. They're all - all of those are in the flight data bag. These are on the suits.
083:55:19|CDR|Yes. We can't talk it over now, because we're going to have get ...
083:55:22|LMP|Okay. Everything's off.
083:55:25|CMP|... Okay. CMC, FREE and then AUTO on the VERB 48. You got the purge line heaters on?
083:55:38|LMP|Yes.
083:55:42|CDR|Okay, CMC, FREE - that's AUTO.
083:55:50|LMP|... and I got 15 minutes.
083:55:53|CDR|... 3, VERB 4 ... --
083:55:54|LMP|... Myrtle here.
083:55:59|CDR|We still want to do a B/D roll, won't we?
083:56:02|CMP|Yes, might as well.
083:56:04|CDR '|I'm going to load 2110. Okay?
083:56:11|CMP|Before you - Hold it just a second before you ENTER. Let me do that one more time, Just to make sure we didn't get out of - Okay. Now enter it. Okay.
083:56:24|CDR|What did you do that for?
083:56:26|CMP|Well, see, we're in a 5-degree dead band.
083:56:27|CDR|Yes.
083:56:29|CMP|If you change that - if you change that to a narrow dead band, it will immediately fire and bring you over to the center of that 5-degree dead band. What cycling this to FREE and AUTO does is - it centers the dead band.
083:56:41|CDR|I already did it once before I called up the 43 ... - -
083:56:43|CMP|Well, I was noticing the roll - the drift up. See, you're going to a - a half a degree dead band - -
083:56:48|CDR|.. . drifted off.
083:56:50|CMP|- - so, anything - more than a half a degree will cause a jet to fire.
083:56:53|CDR|Yes, okay. It was off half a degree?
083:56:56|CMP|Well, you knew, what - what's a half a degree. It was off a little bit.
083:57:00|CDR|The att - it was actually rolling apparently.
083:57:04|CMP|Yes, we're - you know, we're - we were drifting in a 5-degree dead band. It's just that I'm real -See, we just had a firing there. Yes, after we sat there and talked about it. It's - it's the PRO on that 21101. Son of a gun. See, we just wasted some gas. We were talking about it.
083:57:33|CDR|We were talking ... ?
083:57:36|CMP|Yes, But see, if you're moving, you've established it at that point. But then, if you're drifting along - and I should have remembered that, as many times as I've ... watched that. Anyway, you ENTER; and then when you PRO on - on the 21101, what you're doing is, you're shrinking your phase plane now to a half a degree dead band. But you don't change the center.
083:58:06|CDR|You change your center by going to FREE - -
083:58:07|CMP|Yes.
083:58:08|CDR|- - and back to AUTO.
083:58:11|CMP|See, we had already drifted out, because we got the firing.
083:58:13|CDR|Yes, Okay. Well, we should have - -
083:58:15|CMP|Just before we PROed - -
083:58:16|CDR|Just before you PROed - -
083:58:17|CMP|Yes.
083:58:18|CDR|- - not - not just before you ENTER.
083:58:20|CMP|Yes.
083:58:21|CDR|You had the right idea, but you did it the wrong way.
083:58:23|CMP|Yes. Kind of.
083:58:26|CDR|Okay. We're supposed to start the landmark tracking ... here.
083:58:38|CMP|Okay.
083:58:39|CDR|You can do that now ...
083:58:41|CMP|Yes.
083:58:49|CDR|Plus zero.... if we load it that way?
083:58:54|CMP|Yes, it should. Let's try it.
083:59:09|CDR|How about that.
083:59:14|CMP|Okay, we're CMC, AUTO.
083:59:16|LMP|Do you want to use Myrtle, Al?
083:59:18|CDR|Yes; just a second, Ed.
083:59:21|CMP|Ready to go?
083:59:27|CDR|Yes, I'll - I'll flush the water, Ed. I'll he right down there.
083:59:31|þLMP|Okay.
083:59:37|CDR|And you can start the hydrogen and oxygen purge at 5 0. That's 10 minutes.
083:59:44|LMP|Okay.
083:59:46|CDR|And the waste water dump.
083:59:52|LMP|Okay. Get ... going.
083:59:54|CDR|Do you want to use Myrtle, also?
083:59:57|CMP|While it's in here, thank you. I don't really need - no, I don't really need - no, I don't need to. It's going to be awhile before I really get a chance to again. No, I talked myself out of it.
084:00:08|CDR|Okay (laughter).
084:00:10|CMP|You know, it wouldn't hurt us to get that waste water dump started.
084:00:13|LMP|Yes.... do It in a minute.
084:00:15|CMP|
084:00:16|CDR|Yes. I think ... be sure it's all out of the way, so it doesn't screw up your -
084:00:20|CMP|Did you turn the heaters on any earlier, or did you turn them on right at 30?
084:00:24|LMP|What, the hydrogen?
084:00:26|CMP|No - yes.
084:00:28|LMP|No--
084:00:29|CDR|Turned them on 3 minutes early.
084:00:30|CMP|Okay. So we'll wait on that. But -
084:00:46|LMP|This damn thing is ...
084:02:05|CMP|Isn't that something? We - we got so shocked by looking up and seeing the Moon in the window, we didn't do a VERB 82 (laughter).
084:02:14|LMP|... have any doubts?
084:02:16|CMP|No, not after a residual like that.
084:02:21|CDR|No, everything was as advertised all the way down.
084:02:36|CDR|Aei advertised all the way down. Okay ...
084:02:48|CMP|No. Yes, my answer is no. Okay, what time is it? 42? Hell, let's get that water dump going. You ready, Ed?
084:02:58|LMP|Yes, I'm ready.
084:03:01|CMP|You ready for the valves?
084:03:03|LMP|Let her rip.
084:03:19|CMP|Okay. You want DUMP A?
084:03:22|LMP|Let me have it.
084:03:24|CMP|Okay. Ready, go. Cross off A.
084:03:32|LMP|And there's sunup.
084:03:42|CMP|When is AOS this REV? Did they give us a map - -
084:03:46|LMP|They didn't. They - -
084:03:47|CMP|I guess they ran out of time.
084:03:49|LMP|- - let us get behind ...
084:03:50|CDR|They gave us a map update, hut they only gave it to us on the 180 degrees.
084:03:56|LMP|We could extrapolate from the ... - -
084:03:57|CMP|Oh, well - yes, the - at least as my - far as my Solo Book goes, the A0S/L0S was in a minute of -shown in the - on my Solo Book.
084:04:06|LMP|
084:04:07|CMP|All they do is read me the 180 time. So that's probably what they were doing here. In fact, I may have said that. If anybody would say that I said that, I would agree with them.... not anywhere around the points of the Moon, are they?
084:04:34|LMP|No ... can say what way we're pointing.
084:04:37|CDR|We'll be up in the air, because the optics will be pointed down.
084:04:40|LMP|Yes.
084:04:42|CMP|Man, let me see. I need to see the what maps? Oh, you put them - Yes - -
084:04:51|LMP|I put up there.
084:04:52|CMP|- - ... the REV 1. The thing is, that was - Okay. The first one up is going to be Mosting A. And, let me see, I should be getting my camera configured. Well, I have plenty of time to do that.
084:05:47|LMP|What would the 180 time be, Stu, on this REV?
084:05:54|CMP|084:44:53.
084:05:59|LMP|Okay.
084:06:01|CMP|Al's starting the clock over here.
084:06:02|LMP|One minute late. Yes, okay.... 2 minutes.
084:06:10|CDR|... Okay.
084:06:56|CMP|Well, I just missed it - I'll get it at three.
084:07:03|LMP|Okay. H2 purge heaters have been on 20 minutes. We'll have to start the oxygen purge and then a hydrogen purge.
084:07:29|LMP|Okay.
084:07:30|LMP|MARK. Mark, mark, mark.
084:09:16|CMP|Boy, I'm sure glad we cut out that TV show.
084:09:23|LMP|Yes.
084:09:26|CMP|It really worried me, when I saw where it was. Glad we got sort of a pseudoexcuse - to cut it out
084:10:29|LMP|Yes, there it is.
084:10:41|CMP|This is really something. The most unreal looking real thing I've ever seen. If that makes any sense (laughter).
084:10:53|LMP|Probably not.
084:10:58|CDR|... Yes, it is ... vegetation. Something as common reference, you know - familiar reference. So you don't know how far above you are. So it makes it look like the scale is ...
084:11:16|LMP|Okay. Let's terminate waste water dump.
084:11:19|CMP|Okay.
084:11:20|LMP|Fuel cell purge is complete.
084:11:25|CDR|...
084:11:34|CMP|Okay, we're through with this ... heater.
084:11:59|CDR|Fuel cell purge.
084:12:01|LMP|The on-line heater's off.
084:12:03|CDR|CMC is ... line heater's off. Okay.
084:13:00|CDR|... we're in attitude, I guess.
084:13:02|CMP|Yes, we are. Eight minutes.
084:13:34|CDR|OMNI C at 05.
084:13:40|LMP|Say again?
084:13:41|CDR|OMNI C is getting up in 12 minutes.
084:13:43|LMP|Okay.
084:13:45|CDR|05. Sure hope you get to use that blue bag tonight
084:13:57|LMP|You and me both.
084:13:58|CDR|Whaoo!
084:14:19|LMP|Bad.
084:14:22|CDR|Yes .. .
084:14:40|CMP|We ought to be right over -
084:14:46|CDR|
084:14:48|LMP|Stu, are we south of our tra - of the map I have? Are we going over Keeler now, approximately?
084:14:56|CMP|No, we're - -
084:14:57|LMP|We're past Keeler.
084:14:58|CMP|We're going over Minnez - Meinesz or something like that, which is just off to my left.
084:15:05|LMP|Okay, okay. I know where we are.
084:15:18|CMP|It's quite true that I see ... I don't know how aCCurate that is from this high orbit. We're at 22620 ...
084:15:58|CDR|
084:16:54|CMP|There's our Loveletts again. Little Lovelett. That's oriented like that. Okay.... That is Chaplygin....
084:17:11|LMP|Which one's Chaplygin?
084:17:13|CMP|It's off my side.
084:17:19|LMP|Are we headed for Mendeleev?
084:17:22|CMP|That should be over on your right.
084:17:24|LMP|That's what I thought.
084:17:44|LMP|Yes. There it is. The tracks are across the middle of it.
084:17:53|CDR|Those are definitely secondaries in the center of Mendeleev.
084:17:58|CMP|I'm - that's not the current thinking.
084:18:01|LMP|Isn't it?
084:18:02|CMP|No.
084:18:06|LMP|That's a crater chain.
084:18:07|CMP|Crater chain. Right. Davy and -
084:18:09|LMP|Yes, you can sure get fooled easily, but it sure looks like a - batch of secondaries.
084:18:14|CMP|... crater chain hadn't ever seen it. It dees make a difference, doesn't it?
084:18:19|LMP|I'm not about to argue with them at this point.
084:18:22|CMP|What am I supposed to be doing? 84:58. I'm not doing anything, just checking my camera. Okay.
084:18:34|CDR|And null bias check.
084:18:39|CMP|They didn't want me to do that.... the backside.
084:18:43|CDR|Huh?
084:18:44|CMP|You should have done that in the dark.
084:19:47|LMP|
084:20:01|CMP|Hey, my - my ...
084:21:10|LMP|Are we supposed to be doing any photography at all on this ...?
084:22:11|LMP|I have got the crater King out here, Stu, if you were looking for it.
084:22:19|CMP|Yes, that's one of our targets. That's one of Farouk's favorite craters.
084:22:25|LMP|Pretty damn interesting one, too.
084:22:39|LMP|Really an interesting one. Huh? That one ... looks like ... got a rugged one right out here -with the central peaks.
084:23:02|CDR|
084:23:05|LMP|Sure does. Really got a very complex central structure.
084:23:08|CMP|It's got one of the biggest central peaks around. It's a very unusual crater. But there are some dark areas in it that Farouk has gone on record as saying they are dikes.
084:23:37|CMP|High Sun. That's one right down there; just shows how it dominates the whole photograph. Just an extremely bright crater. Sun angle just isn't high enough for you to see it here.... Yes, they're mining it [?], I think.
084:23:58|CDR|What's the name of that one?
084:23:59|CMP|It has no name. I've called it the Bright One. This is Langemak that we're just going over right down here.
084:24:39|CDR|It's got to be fairly fresh, too.
084:24:42|CMP|Yes. It's a very bright crater.
084:24:49|LMP|Hello, Houston; 14. Loud and clear.
084:25:02|LMP|Okay. Give me a second.
085:06:07|LMP|Hey, Al.
085:06:08|CDR|Yes?
085:06:09|LMP|The lineations down here cross the - no, I don't have a big enough chart to cover all this. But they just point right up toward Imbrium. This transition between -
085:06:31|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
085:06:41|CMP|Man, we ... - -
085:06:42|LMP|Just need a wider chart is all.
085:07:22|CDR|Fantastic. A wild view out here with the ... like that, pointing it ... Well.
085:07:37|LMP|Damn it, Copernicus ought to be coming into view.
085:09:29|LMP|.. . Ooh.
085:09:32|CDR|What ?
085:09:33|LMP|We are really up there.
085:09:40|CDR|... isn't it?
085:09:42|LMP|Yes.
085:11:25|LMP|
085:13:07|LMP|Okay. That's Eratosthenes. Yes.
085:13:48|LMP|Houston, 14.
085:13:55|LMP|The beautiful sight on the crater Eratosthenes, Timarcus [sic], and Wallace. Timarcus [sic] is -I mean Timocharis - is Just as - Just on my horizon, as we approach the terminator. Eratosthenes is about halfway to the horizon. They are very stark. It's a magnificent sight.
085:14:47|LMP|Okay. Back to work.
085:14:48|CMP|Okay. Stand by 1.
085:24:45|CDR|Okay. We want to get into 40 for a couple minutes before we have LOS, so they can take a look at it.
085:25:04|CMP|It might be for the P52, too. See, if we didn?t have a roll, I don't know whether it would be a ... or not. Shouldn?t he.... Well, I won't try to figure that out.
085:25:19|CDR|I don't think the roll off ... called 40.
085:25:25|CMP|Yes. Okay. I need - ... I hook every time that come - -
085:25:31||Still maneuvering. What?
085:25:32|CMP|I was just saying, I hook every time I come out of there. I can get my sextant out here.
085:25:37|CDR|Still maneuvering here.
085:25:38|CMP|Yes. Getting farily close.
085:26:00|LMP|How far are we away from that attitude?
085:26:03|CMP|Well, we're about on in roll, and pitch, we've got - oh, a couple of degrees to go.
085:26:09|LMP|Is that all?
085:26:10|CMP|Yes. We don't have but a few more degrees.
085:26:12|LMP|All right.
085:26:26|LMP|Houston, 14. I have you on the high gain.
085:26:30|CC|

085:45:51|CMP|Okay.
085:45:53|LMP|Okay. We've lost them altogether. Okay, there they go.
085:45:57|CDR|What are we looking for today?

085:47:34|CMP|Okay, when you say hack it, I'll freeze them.
085:47:40|CDR|HACK it.
085:47:43|CMP|Okay. 27.8 by 27.1; it passes.
085:47:51|CDR|Okay.
085:48:01|LMP|Okay. Your being in pad burn attitude for the -is causing the comm problem. I?m sure it is. It?s barely hanging on to enough signal strength to talk
085:48:32|CDR|Well, I still can't make that look like Rigel. There's a lot of light out there.
085:48:43|CMP|I saw Orion awhile ago, but - -
085:48:45|CDR|Yes, but so did I - but it sure doesn't look like it now.
085:48:48|CMP|Yes, when I was looking for Procyon.
085:48:51|CDR|Oh, all the light's coming from earthshine, I guess
085:48:55|CMP|Yes. But that's when - See, I had the 60-degree roll in; so the optics were pointed - tetter spot.
085:49:06|CDR|
085:49:12|LMP|Okay, LOS.
085:50:41|CDR|Sure is strange that we can he able to see the rest of the constellations.
085:50:51|CDR|Okay. Optics, ZERO.
085:51:09|CDR|Not enough light out there, I guess. Okeydckey.
085:51:52|SC|...
085:51:54|LMP|I can't see anything but stars.
085:51:56|CDR|What?
085:51:57|LMP|I can't see anything but stars, and we're no longer in earthshine anyhow.
085:52:06|CMP|... I don't know if you want it up there or not.
085:52:08|CDR|No, we're all through with it ...
085:52:11|CMP|Okay. We're in P40, and let's check NOUN 40.
085:52:27|CMP|Okay.
085:52:28|CDR|It's plus 42 coming down on 18.
085:52:30|CMP|And you agree to 206.4 as the total DELTA-V?
085:52:39|CDR|Yes.
085:53:07|CMP|
085:53:08|CDR|Probably came from the LM. A let of those little babies floating around; we brought them back, and they probably just floated out of our pockets.
085:53:22|CMP|I'll put it over here, but it will probably float out of there, too.
085:53:53|CDR|Have you hooked the ... on?
085:53:54|LMP|20.8.
085:53:57|CDR|20.8.
085:53:59|CMP|Okay, what's your confidence on getting a hack on exact burn time now that you have looked at three of them, Ed?
085:54:07|LMP|It's within 2/10ths. .
085:54:12|CDR|Okay, great. Are you going to count down to zero ... 20.8? You have to shut it down on zero.
085:54:24|CMP|We're going to wait until he calls zero, and then move the switches.
085:54:29|CDR|Okay.
085:54:33|CMP|I'll not try to have them off at the time he says zero.
085:54:37|CDR|All right.
085:54:39|LMP|If you do that, the G&N and I are together, it will beat you - if it's -
085:54:44|CMP|Sure. One ... - -
085:54:45|LMP|If it's 2/lOths over, you'll have them off. Let's - let's say, 3/10ths on my time; you'll have them off within 3/10ths and we - we won't overburn more than 3/lOths.
085:55:01|CMP|What's our ullage on this one?
085:55:03|CDR|Four jets - -
085:55:04|LMP|Four Jets; 14 seconds.
085:55:07|CMP|Hey, how's our reading - four - four jets; 14 seconds.
085:55:16|CDR|How's our reading on what?
085:55:17|CMP|The fuel and oxidizer. What are they?
085:55:21|LMP|Right together; 34.9, 35-1; decreased by about 40 pound - 30 - 40 pound.
085:55:31|CDR|Let me just jot that down - 34.9, oxidizer.
085:55:37|LMP|35.1, fuel.

085:59:09|CMP|Why don't you write that AOS time right there?
085:59:14|CDR/LMP|... right where?
085:59:15|CMP|Right there. See, that's the things you'll have out.

086:00:22|CMP|- - or a REV and a half.
086:00:23|LMP|About that. Going to clean up, I think, after DOI, and we can start getting ready.
086:00:30|CMP|No. I think we've got two REVs. We got - because of that bailout bum and stuff, we didn't get a chance to get Descartes, so - -
086:00:37|CDR|- - get the LTC on Descartes.
086:00:39|CMP|Yes, ...- I take a look at this landmark on this one, just for OJT, because there was nothing else we could do; and we've got to bring out the Hycon-on the next pass around - -
086:00:50|LMP|Get Descartes.
086:00:51|CMP|Get Descartes. I'm kind of amazed at the detail you can see - -

086:01:23|CDR|Yes.
086:01:24|LMP|Yes, that's right. We've got plenty of time after the hurn. No rush.
086:01:27|CMP|I don't think you'll be in a good attitude to see it on this one - ...
086:01:31|cm|Must be so - I've been tracking it and it's pretty well angled, as I recall.
086:01:37|CMP|But after the - on the Hycon pass, the hatch should be toward Descartes, so we should be able to see something out of these other windows.
086:01:52|LMP|Well, when you were - tracking with a 16-millimeter, I had a beautiful view out here. Course you - were you rolled?
086:02:03|CLP|No.
086:02:04|LMP|You were - -
086:02:05|CMP|Well, we're going to be just about the same attitude. Let me see - this is 292. We're about 8 minutes to the burn - something like that, ... You want to do ...

086:03:41|CMP|Yes. Yes, he - He got a lot cf his inspiration coming in and out of the DTs, I understand. How did you have it? Did you have it hooked like that?

086:17:13|LMP|Well, the PUGS went pretty much as advertised, except for the crossover, Stu.
086:17:16|CMP|That's what I meant. The PUGS indication z_s what I--
086:17:26|LMP|The crossover was just as smooth as glass.
086:17:39|LMP|As a matter of fact, if I - hadn't realized it was tine for crossover, I'd have still been controlling that thing about a minus 150 at the end of the burn, because there was no indication of - on the gages at crossover.
086:17:56|CDR|You didn't have a high that time, did you?
086:18:03|CM|No, it - it was about 105- Sounds like to me it was just - maybe just a tad over.
086:18:06|CDR|Okay. Everything agreed then. P and burn time and EMS and G&N. L
086:18:11|CMP|No. There's a \"no vote\" thing in there ...

086:19:44|CDR|I don't think you're going to be able to see the landing site. You'll be able to see stuff around it.

086:20:25|LMP|86:53:05, Here we go.
086:20:36|CMP|Hey, Al, when you're - there - there's a book in there, my CSM Landmark Book; I put it in there for the burn, because I think you - I think it's over toward the right, maybe toward the back. Way back in there; it'll be about an inch and a half thick.... There we go.
086:21:01|LMP|Put that in there.
086:21:04|CMP|Thank you.
086:21:29|CMP|Chaplygin, it's a bright crater.

It is really a - it is really a bright thing - ir. the -in the photo. This is a 2000 - this is really a 2001 epic - it's unreal.

086:24:05|CMP|Man ! What a vi ew.
086:24:07|CDR|What ?
086:24:08|LMP|We?re losing our view. We should be coming up on the Crater Mendeleev.
086:24:14|CDR|
086:24:16|LMP|Pardon? Do you have Mendeleev out your side, Stu?
086:24:22|CMP|Nc, it's off to your - to your right.
086:24:24|LMP|That's right, you couldn't - We're too low for you to be able to see across. You have - you should he about over Chaplygin.
086:24:30|CMP|We're past Chaplygin - we're going right over the Lovelett.
086:24:33|LMP|Are you?
086:24:38|CDR'|Look at that.
086:24:39|LMP|Yes. Yes.

086:25:28|CDR|
086:25:29|LMP|Oh. Yes. We're losing all of' it now, aren?t we?
086:25:56|CMP|You know, that - that sharp crater back at Chaplygin was rather phenomenal. Next time we come across there, if you get a chance to see it -it looks like it's been draped around the rim.
086:26:06|CDR|Draped?
086:26:07|CMP|With a - with a darker material. Kind of - It's real fascinating.
086:26:22|LMP|Well, it is pitch black out this window. U can see stars out this window.
086:26:29|CDR|That?s good.
086:26:30|LMP|I'll be damned.

086:28:04|LMP|- - a little early.
086:28:05|CDR|Yes, we're higher, even though we're slower; we'll probably be a little early.
086:28:14|LMP|What are you coming up on, Stu? Okay. You -you're coming up on 11:20.
086:28:28|CMP|We ought to be able to see ... out there. We're just about north of it. You know, it's not as dark - the mare's not as dark as I expected it to cm ^
086:28:38|LMP|Okay. It's sure darker than I expected it to be. Noticeably darker. I really didn't expect it to be that - at this altitude or this close - expect to be able to see that much difference.
086:29:26|LMP|I'm going to see that I'm all set up for this acquisition. Minus 39; plus 325. Okay. I'm HIGH GAIN, MANUAL, WIDE. And 6 minutes away from it.
086:29:53|CDR|On, it looks good through the sextant.
086:29:56|CMP|?What ?
086:29:58|CDR|Sure locks good through the sextant.
086:30:03|CMP|'Well, I think it's got a reddish tint to it out the window. Sort of like, you know, the southwest desert. You know, red hasn't been mentioned before. Do you see Tsiolkovsky over there?
086:30:23|LMP|On, sure; that's Tsiolkovsky. Okay. I've got it. Yes. That mother is black out there, isn't it? And flat. And there are really a lot more color differences than I expected.
086:30:46|CDR|Okay. What's that one that we talked about the other time that had that bench - the bench that looked like a quarry,,
086:30:54|CMP|Oh, the bright one.

086:30:56|CMP|Yes.
086:30:57|CDR|It's got a reddish tint to it. Got a lot of boulders In it, too. That's a really sharp drop in the - in the walls of that baby - really sharp break.

089:59:01|CMP|I guess I'd call them - what? You got a menus 35, 272, and then REACQ, huh? Okay, 80 out of 9C.
090:00:02|CDR|Want to use the Myrtle, Stu?
090:00:05|CMP|Yes. I expect - might as well.
090:00:17|CMP|RATE COMMAND, RATE COMMAND, RATE COMMAND.
090:01:06|CDR|
090:01:32|LMP|Okay. Got some yellow pills for the crew ... pantry, you suppose? Excuse me, Stu?
090:01:48|CMP|Oh, I'm sorry.
090:02:22|CDR|Where are the yellow pills?
090:02:58|CDR|There are the yellow pills.
090:03:52|CDR|Okay, you want to talk over about tomorrow?
090:04:06|CDR|Or do you want to get up a little bit early?
090:04:13|LMP|Huh?
090:05:25|CMP|Okay. From the time they have us getting up -They're going to wake us up at 99:30- Then -They're going to wake us up at 99:30; we've got an hour and a half listed for an eat period; then, they've got you putting on your suits. Are you all squared away on what you're going to take over?
090:05:31|CDR|I think, if we just give ourselves a little extra time, we'll be all right.
090:05:34|CMP|Yes. In fact, I've - Looking over this, I really don't see where we're going to be hurting.
090:05:38|CDR|Well, we still ... one guy, the other guy ...
090:05:56|CMP|You all don't wear helmets and gloves. You just take them with you?
090:06:00|CDR|That's right. That's right.
090:06:07|CMP|Yes. It won't take us long to get the tunnel clear.
090:09:40|CDR|That's wild, isn't it?
090:09:50|CMP|Sure is.
090:10:14|CDR|Well, okay. Is that everything in the flight plan?
090:10:23|CMP|Everything except chlorinate the water, as far as I can tell. Did you do the presleep checklist, Ed? You finished up the presleep checklist, comm and everything, didn't you?
090:10:40|CDR|
090:10:47|CMP|Oh, really?
090:10:50|CDR|... really.
090:11:17|CDR|Couldn't be much of ... now. Couldn't be much of ... now.
090:11:25|LMP|Yes.
090:11:27|CMP|What ?
090:11:29|LMP|Okay.
090:11:32|CDR|... should be minus 35- ?72> right there.
090:12:00|CDR|Okay, Ed. Lunar orbit of sleep. That's lunar orbit of sleep.
090:12:10|LMP|Might be a problem.
090:12:53|CDR|Okay. Why don't we just get up a half an hour early. Stu? ... schedule that at 99:30. If that's for sure, why don't we get up at 99?
090:13:09|CMP|What time is that on the watch?
090:13:12|CDR|Eight hours to the minute.
090:13:14|CMP|Eight hours. That'll be 17:30.
090:13:28|CDR|That sound reasonable?
090:13:41|CMP|
090:13:44|CDR|Huh? Oh, that's good.... sounds all right.
090:13:55|CDR|That way we'11 be sure.
090:15:06|SC|(Cough)
090:15:39|CMP|Oh, did it ever!
090:16:58|CMP|All right ... Where am I? Oh, there I am.
090:18:49|CMP|If I can get out of your way here. I keep ... my feet tripped over.
090:23:04|CMP|Go ahead, Houston. 14.
090:23:26|CMP|Well, I'll tell you what. We ended up with the -the same trouble. Let me - let me run through and tell you what did. Let me get the flight plan out here. TIME SKIP
091:26:44|LMP|You want the towel, don't you?
091:26:53|CMP|What the hell. I thought I had a used towel over there.
091:26:57|CDR|... anyway.
091:27:03|CMP|Here, here's a towel.
091:27:28|CDR|Okay.
091:27:54|CMP|Well, you're supposed to do like I'm thinking, not what I say.
091:28:36|LMP|And let me have the water gun. The top is on it.
091:30:04|CMP|Yes, that ought to do it.
091:30:07|LMP|* ? ?
091:30:10|CMP|What?
091:30:11|LMP|
091:30:13|CMP|No, put the - put the casing back on it, and use it to twist it off.
091:31:11|CMP|What? You shouldn't - as long as you don't have anything in that casing; you're not pushing in on the needle.
091:34:53|CMP|Hey, I think the more - I think from here on out, I'll chlorinate the water (laughter).
091:34:57|SC|...
091:35:00|CMP|Okay, thank you. Appreciate that (laughter).
091:35:33|CMP|It's amazing how fast you can change your orientation.
091:35:34|SC|Yes....
091:35:48|CMP|Man, I looked out here a little bit ago - two REVs ago as we were coming out of the darkness - farside terminator, looking down there - and I - and I didn't know how I was oriented or how - which way the terminator was even running, and it looked just exactly like you were falling straight down -into the surface.
091:36:46|CMP|Yes, I'm ready.
091:36:47|SC|Huh?
091:36:48|CMP|I'm re ady.
091:39:50|CMP|I just saw a flash - with my eyes wide open.
098:49:10|CMP|I believe you cut him off, Edgar.
098:49:12|LMP|Yes. Cut him off in midsentence. Yes. We got the two things he wanted.
098:49:26|CDR|
098:49:34|CMP|They need high bit rate.
098:49:47|LMP|Houston , 14. Do you read now?
098:49:49|CC|14, this is Houston. Roger. We are reading you about 5 by 4. Over.
098:49:58|LMP|Okay. I'm giving you PRIMARY SERVO ELECTRONICS, PRIMARY TRANSPONDER, and what else did you want?
098:50:03|CDR|Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. Let me - -
098:50:04|CC|... We want to go back to TRACK mode, MANUAL; and we'll use the positions that you have set on the FITCH and YAW dials at present.
098:50:15|LMP|Okay.
098:50:30|LMP|Okay, Houston, there's MANUAL.
098:50:32|CMP|Say again?
098:50:43|LMP|God damn it. We have LOS? At what time?
098:51:18|CDR|
098:51:21|CMP|No, I didn't eat that last night. Never got around to it. Why don't you just leave it there? Maybe I'll eat it.
098:51:28|LMP|Houston, 14. Do you read?
098:51:29|CMP|Yes.
098:51:31|CC|Roger, Ed. We're reading you. We'd like you to do a normal manual acquisition, switching back to WIDE BEAM and then coming on over.
098:51:42|LMP|Okay.
098:52:12|CMP|Okay. I'll start mixing up some chow. A1, what would you like first?
099:04:13|CMP|Was that LOS? Must have dropped them. Yes. How in the hell does Bruce think I'm going to copy that shit like that? Oh, he said, \"Well, we're 40 seconds from LOS,\" so he just starts reading, you know, just as fast as he can; and, you know, there's no way you can - -
099:04:30|CDR|... Hycon.
099:04:33|CMP|Yes, this is - what we're going to do with the Hycon - They said they duplicated all the problems in the - in building 4, and it's a low-power problem, and they got all the - all the symptoms. I don't know why they want me to ... - -
099:04:54|SC|
099:05:14|CMP|Let's get out the flight plan there.
099:05:17|SC|
099:05:22|CMP|Verify DSE tape motion; LOW BIT RATE. Yes. It's moving. Okay. We verified that. Now we're in an eat period.
099:05:39|SC|
099:05:48|CMP|Well, they don't want him to do anything until the AOS, at least, which is at 100:30.
099:05:51|CDR|
099:06:13|CMP|Cried the king.
099:07:04|CMP|Screw them, said the commander, and all the subjects began to fornicate. That was a Rocsa original, 1971, at 99 hours and 47 minutes into the midnight flight of Apollo 14.
099:07:29|SC|...
099:07:31|CMP|Yes, okay. Now, you - you went through the manual procedures, and you get three-quarters signal strength?
099:07:36|LMP|
099:08:45|CMP|Would you - would you like some more? I got several packages here. I don't - I just don't chew gum, and I - pack rat, like in survival, you -I save everything that I don't - -
099:09:38|CDR|... number ... on the top and the bottom ...
099:10:08|CMP|I think that'd be a good plan.
099:14:25|LMP|I'm sure shey've got some - some rule that's mandatory for the biomeds for the EVA.
099:14:59|CMP|You want to bet a six-pack? I mean, I don't know, but I'm just - the way the system operates.
099:16:01|CMP|I don't know why Bruce was in such a hurry to do this Hycon troubleshooting, anyway. I don't knew when he thinks I'm going to do that.
099:19:27|CMP|Hey, Ed.... get Myrtle back ...
099:19:43|CMP|. . comm carrier .
099:19:52|CDR|
099:20:25|CDR|What?
099:20:27|LMP|
099:20:34|CDR|I think .. .
099:20:45|CMP|Yes.
099:21:19|LMP|Do you have anything else you can throw away ...? ...
099:24:00|CDR|Sure that's exactly what you wanted ...?
099:28:00|CDR|You don't have it on, do you?
099:28:13|CDR|Just want to make sure, you know.... TPI day, I didn't want the LMP to get nervous here. After ...
099:31:28|CDR|It's down in the bottom of that temporary stowage bag that we rigged up for you. Leave the top part open.
099:31:50|CDR|Now, don't put it on top of any cameras cr anything I think so; I know ... It can sure get messy.
099:34:00|CDR|The only camera I really need is ...
099:34:15|CDR|Yes, it goes flying off into space ...
099:34:22|LMP|What in hell do you expect?
099:34:25|CDR|Yes (laughter).
099:34:32|LMP|...
099:34:40|CDR|I get to go around and drag all the stuff tack into the command module, and then ... (laughter).
099:34:47|LMP|That's it. Just ...
099:37:32|CDR|... here. How about you mixing up the coll part, and I'll mix up the hot part. You agreeable to that?
099:37:40|LMP|Okay.
099:37:53|CDR|You know, I wish they wouldn't put that string on all that. I mean, it helps you find the .stuff, but it's a bitch to - -
099:37:59|LMP|
099:38:01|CDR|Yes. What do you do with all the loose pieces of string? Yes, getting back to Stu....
099:38:58|CMP|You know, they really - like say, like with the PDI or TEI, or something like that - you know, they take a one ... and - -
099:44:09|SC|
099:44:21|CLP|Well, that - that helps with the ... They -they'll take ... the one pad, and they claim that ... go three pads ...
099:44:44|CMP|One in ... two.
099:45:38|CMP|Seven is standard ...
099:50:21|CMP|Seem a lot lower - 40,000 feet over the Moon than 40,000 feet in an airplane - don't you? It's like you could reach down and touch it.
099:51:09|CMP|I still don't know what gave us our trouble a couple of times.
099:53:16|CC|Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. How do you read. Over.
099:53:24|CMP|Read you 5 square, Bruce. How me?
099:53:27|CC|Roger, Stu. We're reading you with a good bit of background noise. We've got a few things to pass up to you at this time, if you're ready to listen.
099:53:43|CMP|Okay. Stand by just 1.
099:53:45|CC|Okay. In the meantime, Stu, for you or Ed, we'd like you to try a normal acquisition again on the high gain antenna, and, if that's NO GO, try acquisition in MANUAL and medium beam width. Over.
099:54:05|CMP|Oks.y. Let me get down here and give it a gc.
099:55:19|CMP|Houston, how do you read 14?
099:55:21|LMP|A1. are you using the same roll-on cuff?
099:55:25|CDR|No.
099:55:26|CC|Okay. Loud and clear, 14.
099:55:30|CMP|Okay, Bruce - -
099:55:31|LMP|Weil, I dried mine, Al.
099:55:32|CMP|- -- doesn't seem to be doing too good. Still can't get the lockup solid all the way.
099:55:37|LMP|I just wonder about - bacteria that's in there.
099:55:38|CMP|I'm in AUTO and MEDIUM, now, and that's where you want it?
099:55:42|LMP|Just - just concerned about the bacteria that's in there.
099:55:45|CC|That's affinnative, 14. And we're checking out Ed's biomed.
099:55:54|CMP|Okay. Ed, they're checking your biomed.
099:55:59|LMP|Okay.
099:56:01|LMP|(Sneeze)
099:56:02|LMP|That's what I hoped they might do.
099:56:03|CC|Okay. In the meantime, an item of general interest or, your orbital status. You started out somewhat high and are decaying at a slightly greater rate than predicted. However, the altitude at FDI will still be about 46,000 feet. That is 46,000 feet or 8.3 nautical miles; so your pericynthior.'s still good. Over.
099:56:11|CMP|Man, that'd be great, docking this baby at night. You know, that's a beautiful sight. Dene good on that one. A little nighttime under your belt.
099:56:23|CDR|Okay. There's LOS; tape motion.
099:56:27|LMP|Great.
099:56:28|CDR|You're on high gain and set up in the proper angles
099:56:30|CMP|Okay, sounds like good planning.
099:56:33|LMP|That gives us more fuel than ever.
099:56:36|CMP|46,000 feet at PDI.
099:57:02|CC|And, Apollo 14, Stu. Map update, REV 11, if you're ready.
099:57:07|CMP|Negative; stand by 1.
100:57:49|LMP|They got those torquing angles on the ground, didn't they?
100:57:51|CDR|Yes. They said they got them.
100:57:52|CMP|They got the torquing angles, and I passed them ...
100:57:56|CDR|Okay. One thing you haven't done, Stu, which you can get later - is your cameras are all here -You have to get that ...
100:58:02|CMP|Yes. I - I'll get all those ...
100:58:07|CDR|Okay. We're going right through gimbal lock on the GDC, and it's going right by. IMU's fine. Okay. CMP is removing the - tunnel hatch. CMP's removing the probe now. Okay. What was the DELTA-?, by the way, Stu? I'll Just jot it down here.
100:58:43|CMP|0.28. I wrote it down there.
100:58:46|CDR|Oh, did you? Okay. It's down again. Okay. 180 is 102:03:40. Three. That'll be 23:26. I could set it on 34.
100:59:45|CDR|Okay, Stu. Your timer is running - coming up t060, which is - the zero of which will be your 180 update time. Okay. You verify tape motion?
101:00:05|LMP|That's verified.
101:00:08|CDR|Do I record the tunnel angle as plus 0.9?
101:00:12|CMP|
101:00:15|CDR|All right.
101:00:38|LMP|I didn't get to brush my teeth this morning.
101:00:45|CDR|Okay, I'll crank in these. Get that GDC set up. 007.5
101:01:28|CDR|Can we help you?
101:02:02|CDR|Do you want to use the spring or you want to use the strap?
101:02:07|LMP|Need the spring to hold the nose down here.
101:02:28|CDR|Oh, I see what tool R is for, is to take those Phillips-head screws off the whole cover, I guess.
101:02:45|LMP|Not very tight. Yes. Go around it one. Much better (clearing throat).
101:03:15|CDR|Let's see - we just leave these out in the hag here, I guess.
101:03:18|LMP|Yes.
101:03:20|CDR|What is it1! Okay. Plus 0.9- Very good.
101:03:57|CDR|Okay. Theoretically - on the overall scheme of things, 101:50 - -
101:04:03|LMP|Roger.... all the way on through.
101:04:05|CDR|No. 101:52. So you got 8 minutes.
101:04:09|LMP|(Cough) Okay. I think we're going to be ahead of it.
101:04:12|CDR|Yes. We're going to be ahead of the time line.
101:04:50|CER|Boy, I sure hope those guys don't get nervous about that BAT 5.
101:04:54|LMP|I do, too (clearing throat). You didn't put down anything.
101:05:00|CDR|Well, jeez, he had a load on it the other day and the damn thing was holding up, wasn't it?
101:05:03|LMP|Yes, but they're - -
101:05:04|CMP|
101:05:05|LMP|All right. We'll start through.
101:05:07|CDR|Okay. We'll put down that you're starting up at 101:46.
101:05:14|LMP|I'll give you a little room there, Stuart, and I'll come right over ...
101:05:32|CDR|Going to get off - Turn your switches off before you get off comm.
101:05:35|LMP|Yes. I'll holler for it. Might as well stay on comm here - -
101:05:39|CDR|I don't know who the hell is going to do it for you.
101:05:41|LMP|Pardon?
101:05:42|CDR|I don't know who's going to do it for you, Ed. I can't get over there, and Stu's going to be getting his suit on. You better - turn them off before you leave.
101:05:51|LMP|01: ay.
101:05:55|CMP|
101:05:57|LMP|Turned the comm switches off.
101:06:01|CDR|You can just yell down, can't you?
101:06:03|LMP|I guess so.
101:06:05|CDR|Yes. See, otherwise - Stu'll be suiting, and -You probably can move a hell of a lot easier with that suit on - without those damn things on, too. Okay. Okay. How you doing, Stu?
101:07:17|CDR|Okay, Stu. Can I help you with your suit in any way?
101:07:21|CMP|Say again.
101:07:22|CDR|Any way I can help you with your suit now?
101:07:25|CMP|
101:07:32|CDR|Yes, we're okay. All we've got is a switch to throw on this LM power. Okay. After the suit, next thing we've got is a switch to throw, and I can do that. That's 13 minutes from now. And the next thing after that - What's that?
101:08:34|CDR|Okay. We're in attitude. I'll go to ENTER now. I'll aline the GDC for you, while I'm here. ROLL 1; ATT SET, IMU.
101:09:25|CDR|GDC. Okay, Stu. You've got a good GDC.
101:09:58|CDR|Are you getting your suit on?
101:10:03|LMP|No.
101:10:11|CDR|Okay. Probe was removed. Drogue was removed.
101:11:07|CDR|Yes, I'm aware of all that. The HIGH GAIN is -is selected from new attitude, and Ed verified -tape motion. Okay, here's a VERB 48 here. Do we change the DAP load here? Yes, we do. Go to wide dead band, here. Okay. Let's see, we just completed the 48-49 maneuver, Stu. And, I've gone to ENTER. We're sitting in P00 in attitude -I'll just go ahead and change the DAP right here from narrow to wide without getting ... on it, right?
101:12:01|CMP|
101:12:03|CDR|We've gone through the 49; got the 58 gainer added, so we're sitting here. We got a narrow dead hand; the flight plan says we swing to a wide dead hand, here; going to do that right now without changing phase plane and getting any jet firing. Okay. VERB 48 ENTER; VERB 21 ENTER; and I'm going tc a 2 and all l's. Okay. 1111. ENTER. And we're still using B/D ROLL. B/D ROLL is set up. We'll PRO on through. Okay, babe, you're in wide lead band.
101:13:17|CDR|How's our friend, the LMP, doing?
101:13:41|CDR|Got to go to a new REFSMMAT, Stu. Going to go to a new REFSMMAT. Have to go to a new REFSMMAT, when I get up in the LM. For me, I mean.
101:13:53|CMP|Yes.
101:13:55|CDR|Okay. Tell him, here I come. Nine reset, off. 101:54:00.
101:14:05|CMP|101:54:00.
101:14:19|CDR|Okay, 4-D, is that zero? Okay, a quick check on it. Okay, very good. We're through with that page. Except for you getting your suit on.
101:14:32|CMP|Yes....
101:14:56|CDR|(Laughter). Okay. It looks like he's still about -4 minutes ahead. So, I'll go up 4 minutes ahead. Tha.t'll put me 102 - 2:05; now it's 2:01. Okay. Stu?
101:15:35|CMP|Yes.
101:15:36|CDR|Stu, I'm going to head on up there. Stay a little ahead of things.
101:16:01|CDR|Okay. Left-hand row, top switch, off.
101:35:35|CMP|I think that's that damned empty box that's been floating around for 3 days.
101:42:00|CMP|Hey, Al. Here's a piece I think came out of you. I think there's a fitting down here that came from you. I don't know if you need it or not. No. Look - Can - can you look over the edge? See it? Where do you leave it? In here? Well, it was floating out here. Where did he have it?
101:42:57|CMP|Okay. I thought it may have come out of the LM.
101:45:10|CMP|Stand by I.
101:45:32|CMP|Yes. Yes, just a second.
101:46:11|CC|Kitty Hawk, Houston.
101:46:18|CMP|Go ahead, Houston; Kitty Hawk.
101:46:21|CC|Okay. We're ready with some updates - -
102:50:38|LMP|Understand. 100, all zeros, 00072.
102:50:49|LMP|Do you have a - an LOS time for me, Fredo?
102:50:55|CC|Okay. I'm showing LOS in about 8 seconds.
102:51:03|LMP|Thank you.
102:55:44|LMP|How you doing over there, Stu?
102:55:47|CMP|Okay.
102:56:12|LMP|Hello, Stu. How do you read?
102:56:14|CMP|Loud and clear.
102:56:15|LMP|Okay. Are you recording E-data on this pass?
102:56:20|CMP|That's affirmative.
102:56:21|LMP|Okay.
102:56:25|CDR|How you doing over there, Stu?
102:56:26|CMP|Okay. I got a little behind on my suit check. I left these other suit hoses on FLOW instead of OFF, and - so that kicked me a little behind by the time I psyched that out, but I?m about to catch up.
102:56:43|LMP|Okay - -
102:56:44|CDR|It looks like we're back on the time line ourselves We're going to proceed with our PGA integrity check now.
103:02:15|LMP|... check the tunnel ... - -
103:02:16|CDR|Stu, has the tunnel been vented?
103:02:20|CMP|It's been at greater than 3.5 pounds, and I don't have my roll back on yet. It passed the check. I'm just getting my gloves off now. I'll get my roll jets on, and I'll trim you up to the AGS CAL.
103:02:38|LMP|Okay.' We not - we're not quite there yet. Thank you.
103:02:42|CDR|We're ahead of the time line, Stu, so there's no hurry.
103:06:02|CMP|Hey, are you firing jets up there?
103:06:05|CDR|No, we just dumped a little of the cabin to check the suit valves - is probably what we pushed you - what gave you a little push.
103:06:19|CMP|Okay. Man,, that went good.
103:06:32|CDR|How about that, babe? I guess maybe they didn't make allowance for that in computing your - How goes it?
103:06:40|CMP|Yes. They ought to have a call for me to go FREE or something there.
103:07:31|CMP|Okay, I'm going to trim you up for the AGS CAL.
103:07:34|CDR|Okay. Good.
103:08:22|LMP|You know, Stu, on that DEPRESS firing, I guess tnere's nothing we can do except squirt a little bit out, and you'll have to stop it. It costs you fuel, under any circumstances, I guess.
103:08:32|CMP|Yes, but see, I have to start a maneuver back to the AGS CAL attitude anyway. So - But no sweat. I'm going to - I'll go - -
103:08:44|CDR|How are you doing on the fuel? How goes it ... anyway?
103:08:49|CMP|I didn't have time to plot It.
103:11:35|LMP|Stuart, when you're through with your maneuver, let me know, please, and I'll go ahead with my check.
103:11:42|CMP|Ckay.
103:15:29|CMP|Okay, Ed, I'm here. But we ought to wait a minute or 2 here to make sure the rates are damped.
103:15:35|LMP|Okay. This test is pretty gross, so it doesn't really hurt anything. This is for my rate gyros.
103:15:47|CMP|Okay. All the rates are pretty well damped.
103:15:52|LMP|Thank you.
103:17:41|CDR|Okay, Stu, you ready for a snapshot on the NOUN 20?
103:17:47|CMP|Okay. Get a VERB 06 55 up. I - I mean a NOUN -VERB 06 NOUN 20.
103:17:54|CDR|Okay.
103:17:56|CMP|VERB ... VERB 06 NOUN 20, and I'm ready to ...
103:18:07|CDR|One -
103:18:08|CDR|MARK.
103:18:09|CMP|Hey, give me another mark on that, Al.
103:18:16|CDR|Okay. VERB 06 NOUN 20. Stand by, 3, 2, 1 -
103:18:25|CDR|MARK.
103:18:26|CMP|Okay, on your mark, I read plus 00, plus 69, plus 11304, plus 02288.
103:18:42|CDR|Okay. I had as a GET 103:58:25, 00769 - That's a good one - 11304, 02288.
103:18:58|CMP|That's affirmative.
103:18:59|CDR|Okay.
103:20:20|CMP|Okay, I just switched comm on ... How do you read?
103:20:23|CDR|Beautiful. Loud and clear.
103:20:27|CMP|Okay.
103:21:06|CDR|Okay, Stu, could you verify that you have a 3-3 thruster, off, o-f-f? Radar TRANSPONDER, OFF, 0-F-F.
103:21:14|CMP|Verify the transponder is off, and ...
103:21:20|CDR|Okay.
103:21:21|CMP|And verify G&C thruster 3 is cff.
103:21:24|CDR|Good show. I'm going with the rendezvous radar check. Be back with you momentarily.
103:22:23|LMP|Stu. I'm ready to start my AGS CAL.
103:22:36|CMP|Okay. The rates are damped, and I'm going CMC, FREE, now.
103:22:40|LMP|Okay.
103:24:01|LMP|Okay. You say you're CMC, FREE, now. Is that affirmative?
103:29:30|LMP|Stu, you can enable all thrusters, except B-3.
103:31:58|CMP|Say, Al, how much longer do you think it'll be before I can get B-3 out?
103:32:03|CDR|Just a minute.
103:33:32|LMP|It'll take about 2 more minutes, Stu.
103:35:01|LMP|Okay, Stu, you can enable B-3-
103:35:07|CMP|And can I turn my transponder off?
103:35:11|LMP|Roger; that's affirmative.
103:35:12|CDR|Affirmative.
103:36:00|CMP|Okay. Are we going to start a maneuver?
103:36:02|CDR|Okay.
103:36:03|LMP|Okay.
103:39:54|CMP|Hello, Houston. Do you read Kitty Hawk?
103:40:03|CMP|Okay.... standing by for a GO for SEP.
104:15:54|LMP|And the camera has started, Fredo, as we crossed Lalande N and NA.
104:16:07|LMP|Might even get a picture of Stu ahead of us; we're crossing Lalande C.
104:18:03|LMP|Okay, Fredo. We're coming over Turner Crater. It looks just like on the map as we approach the site
104:18:36|LMP|They don't seem quite as long as on the map, Fredo
104:20:27|CDR|Okay, Houston.- We've spotted the general - the general area of the landing site from Rina Parry on in. We didn't spot Cone Crater on this pass, however.
104:20:52|LMP|And, Fredo, as we come up on Lansberg here, it's -the terminator's running right across it. And it is a big one. It really has some - a steep rim -or rather a high rim, a very noticeably high rim for here - from - from here. And it's right -the terminator goes right through it.
104:44:22|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
104:44:36|LMP|Was that for Antares?
104:44:42|LMP|Okay. We'll get it going around the corner.
104:45:00|LMP|Hey, Houston, clarify -
104:45:39|CMP|Kitty Hawk, Antares.
104:45:41|LMP|You're loud and clear.
104:45:43|CMP|Okay ...
104:45:47|LMP|Okay. And you have it.
105:07:31|CMP|Okay, Antares. How do you read on VOX?
105:07:37|CDR|Okay. Loud and clear.
105:07:38|LMP|Loud and clear. Tape recorder's on, S-band - ...
105:08:03|???|Houston, I have you locked up on the steerable.
105:08:15|LMP|Okay, let me keep you honest, Al.
105:08:28|LMP|I ... hold off on it until you do.
105:08:32|CDR|Give me about 5 seconds, Stu. I need another 5 seconds.
105:08:38|CMP|
105:08:41|LMP|***' Okay, BI0MED *** LEFT-, PCM *** HI.
105:08:47|CMP|... zero. Will you be ready to go at 5? Are you ready, Al?
105:08:55|CDR|We're ready. Go.
105:09:01|CMP|And you're hanging on the end of the probe. We'll wait until motions damp here, Okay. We seem real steady. I'm going to back off from you.
105:09:15|CDR|Okay. Very good.
105:09:28|CDR|Okay. We had a normal undocking, Houston.
105:09:36|LMP|Okay. DEAD BAND, MIN; VERB 77; go to P00.
105:10:12|LMP|Stu, are you going to be able to burn on time? Okay. We don't see you, but I guess we will when you light off.
105:11:03|LMP|Give us a 15-second warning if you - can, Stu.
105:11:14|CMP|About 35 seconds. Have 30. EMS, NORMAL.
105:11:21|LMP|Great, we're watching. We're with you. Good; keep going.
105:11:59|CMP|Okay.
105:12:00|CMP|SHUTDOWN.
105:12:02|LMP|Gee, we sure didn't see a thing, Stuart. Oh, I just saw a flash up there. His tracking light,
105:12:19|CDR|Huh? See his tracking light on or something?
105:12:28|LMP|Saw a couple of flashes.
105:12:31|CDR|Yes - -
105:12:49|LMP|You have a mighty invisible engine, Stu. It didn't have anything we could see at all from here.
105:16:42|CMP|Okay, Ed. The burn went off. Surprisingly enough, it was 2-foot-per-second overburn; I turned it back to - to one and ...
105:19:57|LMP|That's interesting, Stu; we never saw your burn at all; but at the same time, when you burst into sunlight, you were right ahead of us. We were pointed right at you, but we didn't see a thing.
105:20:47|LMP|Stu, we ha - have your - your apogee/perigee numbers for comparison, if you'd like them.
105:20:53|CMP|Okay. I've got a 53.9 by 56.0,
105:21:00|CDR|Okay, we're showing 56.1 hy 63.5.
105:21:07|LMP|Good enough.
106:43:44|CMP|... l/200th - and, I guess, fire a frame, remove the magazine, look at the slit, see if it's an inch from the side rail - and I guess I see some sprockets in there, and then - if it is 1 inch, I'll put the magazine back in , fire another frame, and check that the slit is still there. If it's out in the center somewhere - Well, then we've got big problems.
107:28:20|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
107:28:45|CDR|Okay, stand by. Let's get locked up on the main lobe, Fred.
107:29:08|CDR|And, in the meantime, do you still read me?
107:29:15|CDR|Okay, ASCENT BATs went on at 108:01:45.
107:29:33|CDR|
107:29:35|LMP|Okay.
109:38:11|CMP|Houston, 14, How do you read? ...
109:38:30|CMP|Well, how're the troops of Antares making out? Do you have an estimate on the landing spot yet, Ren?
109:38:51|CMP|How far from the spot? Did they - they come right in on the first pick?
109:39:05|CMP|Roger. Are they right on the target?
109:39:26|CMP|Oh, okay.
109:43:41|CMP|Houston, 14 - Kitty Hawk.
109:43:51|CMP|Hey, Ron, got any word on how the low-altitude pass on 11-1 and the high-altitude compare?
109:44:11|CMP|Okay.
109:44:36|CMP|Okay.
110:14:04|CMP|All right, Ron. I tried to change the camera and put the sextant on and take a look at the site.
110:40:44|CMP|And, Houston; Kitty Hawk.
110:40:51|CMP|Hey, Ron. Has - Is somebody thinking up an - any words about our Descartes photography? Does it look like the Hycon's wiped out; are we going to do the C0AS or - Any decision on that?
110:41:13|CMP|Okay.
110:41:20|CMP|And - somebody ...? E'oes it look like the Hycon's wiped out?
111:15:35|CMP|Left, left, and .. .
111:18:31|CMP|That son of a bitch.
111:21:43|CMP|Oks.y, we're getting ready to start the zero-phase observations on target 1. I'm now running - DET was started at - T-start at 111:59:43 and I'm waiting to try again.
111:22:20|CMP|First target at 8:07.
111:23:26|CMP|... 5.
111:23:43|CMP|Okay, starting at 9:05.
111:23:58|CMP|... yet. If not ... -
111:24:29|CMP|And approaching 4 minutes.
111:25:02|CMP|Okay, there are my targets. Targets A, B, C.
111:25:26|CMP|Okay, standing by to start the time. That's 5 minutes.
111:25:43|CMP|MARK, Intervalometer going. Okay, I have targets A, B, and C. C will be the first into the zero-phase. Picked them up without any difficulty at all.... anyway. Intervalometer ... again.
111:26:14|CMP|And A, B - Okay, looks like C is Just about ir. zero-phase now. And I really have lost C at zero-phase. That's a pretty good picture there. As it moved into zero-phase, it was essentially wiped out.
111:26:33|CMP|Now it's coming back out again.
111:26:46|CMP|Okay, B. You just almost lose B going to zero-phase. I can tell where it is by the other craters -pointing at it. But, if you didn't have that help, it'd be tough.
111:27:12|CMP|And now we're going into - A's going ir. toward zero-phase. In fact, I'm quite surprised how washed out they do become. I had anticipated I would be able to stay with them a little more than that.
111:27:33|CMP|Well, we're going - It's 7 minutes, so A will be moving towards zero-phase. And it's pretty much the same story. Zero-phase is that - is that condition - it - it really - Kind of surprising how it - how it wipes it out, I think you can tell the general area, on B in particular, that with the lead-in, you could - you could find it. With -with B, it's pretty much totally wiped out at -at zero-phase, and A had a little better landmarks around it.
111:28:25|CMP|Okay, I'm switching to second target new. .And A shows up extremely well. B is - you can see 3 here now. It's just starting to go into - into zero-phase as it moves on up. But B is a - 3's a mighty rough target, even without zero-phase,
111:29:09|CMP|And you can - you can hang onto A pretty well. B - B, just - I just didn't find long enough to give a good - a good impression on that one - on that one, I guess, overall, I'd rate it - at -
111:29:47|CMP|But A in - in target 2, you can almost hang onto B in target 1 -
111:30:08|CMP|Now, of course, target 2-B is hard to find even under good conditions, so - but it'd be impossible at the - at the zero-phase point. And I'm going to quit now, and I'll give you a little summary here. I'll rate these as I - by the criteria that we set up. Okay, on target 1, I'd rate C -
111:30:45|CMP|Okay, I'm going to turn off the intervalometer. No. Let it run for another 20 seconds. But I - I'm so far out, I - I really can't - It says you got to let the DAC run until 12:24. Okay. All right, I'd rate - I'd rate C in area 1 - I'd rate C as low; B as medium, and A is - is low; 2-A, medium; and B, very low.
111:31:52|CMP|I think what would really help you is - is relief around, like C was out pretty flat. And then, when It got zero-phase, it pretty well wiped it out. But - okay, and on my mark, the DAC will be going off. Stand by.
111:32:11|CMP|MARK. I let it slip one.
111:32:13|CMP|MARK. There, that was the last picture on targets 1 and 2,
111:32:21|CMP|And just a little more on the debriefing, I think if there's some relief around, it helps you quite a bit. Like C was out flat, and you'd lose it. B, I had the good chain of craters going into it, so you could pick that up, and - and A, also. It was the landmarks that really - really had you pick it up. But when it's out flat, it just washed it out completely.
111:33:08|CMP|Okay, Houston, Kitty Hawk,
111:33:59|CMP|344.7, 340.9, ...
111:34:17|CMP|Hello, Houston. This is Kitty Hawk.
111:36:57|CMP|Kitty Hawk. How do you read?
111:37:07|CMP|Well ... I never saw B at all, and A ... pick up ... zero-phase, B was just completely wiped out.... clue is ... some relief by you, even in zero-phase ... best of the three . . , pretty well hang ... and A was about ...
111:38:31|CMP|Well ...
111:38:38|CMP|Okay ... on the tape ... this other ...
111:40:50|CMP|... loud and clear ...?
111:41:09|CMP|Okay, you've always been loud and clear ...
111:41:30|CMP|Okay, Ron; are you going to let the tape run for the ... next sighting?
111:46:55|CMP|And, Houston; Kitty Hawk, Do you want me to terminate the charge on B and start one on Able?
111:47:10|CMP|Okay.
111:55:36|CMP|Okay, thank you.
112:00:36|CMP|Okay, I'll do that.
112:00:56|CMP|And stand by.
112:00:59|CMP|MARK. Camera's running. Five minutes. Okay, and now I can pick up to Ptolemaeus, to Ptolemaeus A, and I can pick up Bright Crater. Yes, even at this low elevation, targets A and B show up real well. The trouble of it is, it doesn't look to me like the camera's on target, but - They're a little too far to the left. But, anyway, I can't see targets -both targets A and B by themselves. I guess I used that little bright crater up by B, maybe as a gouge, but it showed up pretty well. There's no problem on acquisition, Houston. Appear to just be getting better as I - as I come up in elevation. Of course, I guess it wouldn't surprise me to come up cere and see that I picked up the wrong target.
112:02:18|CMP|I really don't think this camera's pointed right, Ron. It's boresighted right down - looks like the junction between Ptolemaeus and Alphonsus. But, anyway, my - both targets A and B - had no trouble acquiring these and no trouble sticking with them. Even A is the - the hardest; it's not quite as straight, Now B had a - had a bright rim and showed up at the very start of the - of the observation. A is - is a little more subdued, but it was quite easy to pick up and hang on to. And that's - that's really a no-sweat on - on this one, much - much easier than the - those on the backside. In fact, I rated some of those with zero. And I'd have to give them up on - on both these targets - Cone Crater.
112:03:34|CMP|And the hard part is over, once you acquire them at that low elevation. In fact, the elevation is as difficult as - any sort of Sun problem, That would be here, as we go - go towards the zero-phase; I guess it's probably still about 08:40 and I'd guess about 40 minutes to go. It's still hanging in there right now. No - no problem at all. Particularly B, it's - it hasn't the - the bright surface on the center across the crater -that makes it that much easier. Let's see, I can see the zero-phase. And I guess the camera was pointing at it as we get up here closer. And I can see zero-phase now, approaching target A, so this should be a - a good test. Been no problem to acquire up to now.
112:04:39|CMP|There's zero-phase just about on A, and the camera took the picture. Okay, we went through zero-phase on A with - with no problem - hanging on to the landmark itself.
112:04:56|CMP|Zero-phase is passing B - at this time. And it, again, is definitely no problem.
112:05:12|CMP|And now, as we come cut of the - out of the zero-phase, it gets constantly better, of course. And I'll be switching targets at 09:58. It's 09:24 now. Both targets at Ptolemaeus are ready to pick up. Of course, it's no problem now picking those up.
112:05:59|CMP|Okay, we're going to switch now and take a look at - at Parry. And - actually, this one here is again extremely easy. You can pick up both -both targets A and B as soon as you see it, r.c sweat. I think you'd use the - of course, you'd use the - Parry and Parry M to guide you into the area. But once you got into the area, why. A and B just stand out so good that, here again, it's -primarily - it's - the elevation angle helps, because we're up a little higher and - and, also, the bright crater stages show up extremely well. It's like you got the crater with a bright rim. It really helps with low elevation.
112:07:08|CMP|In fact, zero-phase is approaching - approaching the area now. And both targets are - are hanging in there .
112:07:22|CiIF|Camera went just right at zero-phase. And here again, it was extremely easy to recognize the targets - this would be - really, again, a nosweat proposition to pick the targets up. Zero-phase - really doesn't have that big an effect on -on these two targets.
112:08:10|CMP|Okay. And now, I'll stop and rate them here; seems like a good time, I guess target A was extremely good all the way along. Target B, also, was quite easy to recognize. But here again, prim - primarily because of the - of the Sun shining on the - on the crater rim. An older, more diffuse crater would be more difficult to pick up, but with those -with those bright - bright rims - bright side to -both targets A and B, it was really no problem. Okay, And my last picture, I will give you a mark. When it goes off, it'll be a little past 12:32.
112:09:21|CMP|And -
112:09:22|CMP|MARK. Last picture on target 4, Camera is off.
112:11:11|CMP|Okay. I'll get to moving here, and then I'll pick me up at - oh, maybe between 50 and 58. First frame number should be eight.
112:13:42|CMP|Okay. Just a couple of more comments while they're fresh in my mind. I think there was a big difference between the frontside and the backside passes , and that's primarily because, on the - on the front side, we're picking out craters that were out in a flat area. And they had the rim up behind them to - to guide you in on it. I think you'd - you'd use the - the large, gross features to get you pointed in the right area of the - of the mare or the flat surface, and - and then, the - the rim of the crater would - would - would show up. And you could guide in on it. Both those craters at Parry were quite fresh; they had a bright rim, The target A in the Ptolemaeus was fairly subdued - but still, yet, it did show up, and you could hold on to it right through zero-phase. So, let me see, I' c. rate -
112:15:16|CMP|I'c. rate both - both targets 3 and 4 - high.
112:39:07|CMP|A-3, C-4, B-3. A-3. C-4 - Okay, Ron. A-3, C-4, B-3, D-4.
112:39:57|CMP|Oks.y, Make sure she's running.
112:41:40|CMP|Verify ...
112:42:07|CMP|Configure camera - the right one, ...
112:45:09|CMP|Okay, On the zodiacal light : The - after the first 20-second frame, I got out of shut - sync on the shutter, and I fired off two more frames before I got down to - to 10 seconds. And then I went to 10 seconds and then 5 seconds, in order.
112:45:55|CMP|And I was also a little late getting started. I started at about 6 minutes, instead of 5. And I'll get these others on time here; 8:20, we're looking for.
112:46:23|CMP|Open.
112:46:36|CMP|27, 37. Okay, three - three on 10 -
112:46:59|CMP|Okay. Two on 5 ?
112:47:08|CMP|Okay. The 8:20 went just as advertised; 20, 10, and 5. So far, the only thing extra was the -one on the - first one.

116:16:44|CMP|Well, great. Looks like we made It.
116:35:34|CMP|No, I didn't get that yet. Do you want to let it run on through until I come out AOS, or do you want - When do you want that terminated?
116:35:49|CMP|Okay.
117:29:07|CMP|Okay. Thirty seconds, and everything looks good here.
117:29:23|CMP|Okay. ULLAGE is on.

117:29:37|CMP|IGNITION. And she's steady as a rock
117:29:54|CMP|And SHUTDOWN.
131:55:26|CC|Roger; I copied - copied all of that.
131:57:20|CC|Roger. Serial number 1002 and 305.
131:58:05|CC|Okay. Give me a call when you get there, and I'll start the timing.
131:58:16|CC|Starting the clock.
131:59:59|CC|Go ahead, Ed.
132:00:50|CC|Okay. I got all - all readings, Ed.
132:00:58|CC|Roger. High scale.
139:03:02|CMP|Okay. We're getting ready to start the zero-phase observations on targets 5 and 6. We're a minute and a half past the T-start time; waiting for 5 minutes - to put on the camera.
139:03:25|CMP|Passed over target 1.
139:03:36|CMP|Sure is a lot of difference with this low Sun than there was yesterday. Kind of amazing about C; how - in particular, how it - You really lose it at zero-phase,
139:05:20|CMP|Well, tell you what. At this low - Sun angle, you can see a B on target 2, but it's still - still almost unidentifiable; that's just really a tough target. A shows up real well at this low Sun angle You'd be hard put to call which crater was B - at any Sun angle.
139:06:02|CMP|Okay, At 04:20, turning on the DAC here shortly. Camera ...
139:11:13|CMP|And I lost them all - So on that one, at the switch point, I could not pick up target A at all. It was just too subdued. B was easy to pick up, and 0 also. C - C was - was very easy to pick up. Going through zero-phase, B was completely wiped out; A, I never did have to start with, so it was wiped out; and C - C held through zero-phase and reasonably well; but as it got further on up, it, too, got pretty well wiped out. I think it's the same bit of being on the - being on the backside. You Just - The terrain is - You don't have the flat mare surface to give you the relief that - that you need to pick out - to pick out the targets. It's - what - very little contrast In albedo, and -you - you Just don't have the - the ability to see the darks and lights like we did on the frontside pass yesterday. And, I guess, in summary now, for targets 3 - very easy to pick up at the time I picked them up; of course, the Sun was low on them. And I'm going to turn off this ... test lever under panel 18. Okay, I'll leave it on a little longer and debrief onto the tape. A - A, B, and C on target 3 picked up very easily. Saw them into zero-phase; surpri - B is a fairly shallow crater, but it even held up as good as C. I'd put 3 and C both completely wiped out at zero-phase. A held to zero-phase; but then, as it went on up, you surely couldn't have picked it up - by itself, if you didn't know the relation to some other terrain. All three of those were - Once you're well past zero-phase, it'd be a rather marginal target. And, on target 6, I never got A at all - it was already wiped out. B went real fast in zero-phase approach. C, you could still identify after zero-phase, but Just because you knew it was there. And then, it
139:15:31|CMP|Okay. Let me see if I can pick up the high gain,
139:15:48|CMP|It ought to be getting better real fast.
139:15:57|CMP|Okay. And stand by Just 1; I'll make - I want to mate a couple of notes here. And - -

164:49:07|LMP|Roger. That's what I understand as a normal acquisition, hut I - I thought I heard the word REACQ a couple of times, implying a position of the antenna, and I was confused on that one.
164:49:25|LMP|Okay, Houston.
170:34:16|LMP|Okay.
170:34:40|LMP|Houston, 14.

215:37:40|CMP|Net yet, no.
215:37:41|CDR|Probably too much light in here. Why don't you flip your floods off and see if you can see a dark horizon.
215:37:48|CMP|The Moon is awful bright. I sure don't. All I see is a -
215:38:04|LMP|In other words, it must be shifting. Let's see, we've get - on the tape recorder - we have 30 minutes of high-bit-rate recording, don't we?
215:38:24|CMP|3C minutes? Yes. There's a decal down there that tells you that,. You might verify. I think it's 3C minutes for 4 hours or something.
215:38:32|LMP|I thought there was, too, but I don't see it.
215:38:35|CMP|Right by the HIGH switch? I saw that somewhere
215:38:39|LMP|That's right. Right, 30 minutes in 2 hours. Okay, we've got 10 minutes to interface and 13 minutes, so with 23, we've got plenty of high-bit-rate time.
215:39:05|CDR|Houston, 14.
215:39:18|LMP|Okay, Stu, you - ckay, there's the Moon. I've got the Moon in 2. Moonset is 25:15-

215:40:48|CDR|Okay, as we reported, we got a good separation; we're back in plane; and we're following the horizon on down. Yes, there it is. Look at the airglow. No. Hell, that's -
215:41:07|LMP|Yes, there's the horizon.
215:41:08|CDR|Yes. It's a good solid horizon. You really don't see any airglow.

215:41:53|CDR|Supposed to be set on the left-hand side, isn't it?
215:41:55|LMP|Yes. And it's almost sitting out cf my window.
215:41:56|CDR|I got it.
215:41:57|LMP|Yes, but it's - My window's the one that's got the camera in it.
215:42:00|CDR|Oh, you want it then.
215:42:01|CMP|We want to try to get a picture of the Moon sitting there. We show -
215:42:05|LMP|If you could yaw to about 5 degrees -
215:42:06|CDR|Give it to me. Give it to me. I'll do it handheld, if you want.

215:42:53|CMP|That's right, and we need this to back up at 32.
215:42:58|CDR|If it doesn't work.
215:42:59|CMP|If it doesn't work. No matter what that reads, at 32, this switch goes off.
215:43:06|CDR|32?
215:43:08|CMP|At 32, right here.
215:43:10|CDR|Oh. That's true. If you don't have your .Cog light.
