03 11 56 29,CMP,If you change that - if you change that to a narrow dead band [comma]  it will immediately fire and bring you over to the center of that 5-degree dead band. What cycling this to FREE and AUTO does is - it centers the dead band.

But then [comma]  if you're drifting along - and I should have remembered that [comma]  as many times as I've ... watched that. Anyway [comma]  you ENTER; and then when you PRO on - on the 21101 [comma]  what you're doing is [comma]  you're shrinking your phase plane now to a half a degree dead band. But you don't change the center.
03 11 58 06,CDR,You change your center by going to FREE - -
03 11 58 07,CMP,Yes.
03 11 58 08,CDR,- - and back to AUTO.

03 12 20 01,CMP,Hey [comma]  my - my ...
03 12 21 10,LMP,Are we supposed to be doing any photography at all on this ...?
03 12 22 11,LMP,I have got the crater King out here [comma]  Stu [comma]  if you were looking for it.
03 12 22 19,CMP,Yes [comma]  that's one of our targets. That's one of Farouk's favorite craters.
03 12 22 25,LMP,Pretty damn interesting one [comma]  too.
03 12 22 39,LMP,Really an interesting one. Huh? That one ... looks like ... got a rugged one right out here -with the central peaks.
03 12 23 02,CDR,
03 12 23 05,LMP,Sure does. Really got a very complex central structure.
03 12 23 08,CMP,It's got one of the biggest central peaks around. It's a very unusual crater. But there are some dark areas in it that Farouk has gone on record as saying they are dikes.
03 12 23 37,CMP,High Sun. That's one right down there; just shows how it dominates the whole photograph. Just an extremely bright crater. Sun angle just isn't high enough for you to see it here.... Yes [comma]  they're mining it [?] [comma]  I think.
03 12 23 58,CDR,What's the name of that one?
03 12 23 59,CMP,It has no name. I've called it the Bright One. This is Langemak that we're just going over right down here.
03 12 24 39,CDR,It's got to be fairly fresh [comma]  too.
03 12 24 42,CMP,Yes. It's a very bright crater.
03 12 24 49,LMP,Hello [comma]  Houston; 14. Loud and clear.

03 13 06 41,CMP,Man [comma]  we ... - -
03 13 06 42,LMP,Just need a wider chart is all.
03 13 07 22,CDR,Fantastic. A wild view out here with the ... like that [comma]  pointing it ... Well.
03 13 07 37,LMP,Damn it [comma]  Copernicus ought to be coming into view.
03 13 09 29,LMP,.. . Ooh.
03 13 09 32,CDR,What ?
03 13 09 33,LMP,We are really up there.

Timarcus [sic] is -I mean Timocharis - is Just as - Just on my horizon [comma]  as we approach the terminator. Eratosthenes is about halfway to the horizon. They are very stark. It's a magnificent sight.
03 13 14 47,LMP,Okay. Back to work.
03 13 14 48,CMP,Okay. Stand by 1.
03 13 24 45,CDR,Okay. We want to get into 40 for a couple minutes before we have LOS [comma]  so they can take a look at it.
03 13 25 04,CMP,It might be for the P52 [comma]  too. See [comma]  if we didn?t have a roll [comma]  I don't know whether it would be a ... or not. Shouldn?t he.... Well [comma]  I won't try to figure that out.
03 13 25 19,CDR,I don't think the roll off ... called 40.

03 13 25 31,,Still maneuvering. What?
03 13 25 32,CMP,I was just saying [comma]  I hook every time I come out of there. I can get my sextant out here.

03 13 25 38,CMP,Yes. Getting farily close.
03 13 26 00,LMP,How far are we away from that attitude?
03 13 26 03,CMP,Well [comma]  we're about on in roll [comma]  and pitch [comma]  we've got - oh [comma]  a couple of degrees to go.
03 13 26 09,LMP,Is that all?
03 13 26 10,CMP,Yes. We don't have but a few more degrees.
03 13 26 12,LMP,All right.

03 13 47 51,CDR,Okay.
03 13 48 01,LMP,Okay. Your being in pad burn attitude for the -is causing the comm problem. I?m sure it is. It?s barely hanging on to enough signal strength to talk
03 13 48 32,CDR,Well [comma]  I still can't make that look like Rigel. There's a lot of light out there.
03 13 48 43,CMP,I saw Orion awhile ago [comma]  but - -
03 13 48 45,CDR,Yes [comma]  but so did I - but it sure doesn't look like it now.
03 13 48 48,CMP,Yes [comma]  when I was looking for Procyon.
03 13 48 51,CDR,Oh [comma]  all the light's coming from earthshine [comma]  I guess

03 13 54 07,LMP,It's within 2/10ths. .
03 13 54 12,CDR,Okay [comma]  great. Are you going to count down to zero ... 20.8? You have to shut it down on zero.
03 13 54 24,CMP,We're going to wait until he calls zero [comma]  and then move the switches.
03 13 54 29,CDR,Okay.
03 13 54 33,CMP,I'11 not try to have them off at the time he says zero.

04 06 56 26,CMP,Okay. I got a little behind on my suit check. I left these other suit hoses on FLOW instead of OFF [comma]  and - so that kicked me a little behind by the time I psyched that out [comma]  but I?m about to catch up.
04 06 56 43,LMP,Okay - -
04 06 56 44,CDR,It looks like we're back on the time line ourselves We're going to proceed with our PGA integrity check now.

04 07 06 19,CMP,Okay. Man [comma]  [comma]  that went good.
04 07 06 32,CDR,How about that [comma]  babe? I guess maybe they didn't make allowance for that in computing your - How goes it?

04 07 07 31,CMP,Okay [comma]  I'm going to trim you up for the AGS CAL.
04 07 07 34,CDR,Okay. Good.
04 07 08 22,LMP,You know [comma]  Stu [comma]  on that DEPRESS firing [comma]  I guess tnere's nothing we can do except squirt a little bit out [comma]  and you'll have to stop it. It costs you fuel [comma]  under any circumstances [comma]  I guess.
04 07 08 32,CMP,Yes [comma]  but see [comma]  I have to start a maneuver back to the AGS CAL attitude anyway. So - But no sweat. I'm going to - I'll go - -

04 08 16 07,LMP,Might even get a picture of Stu ahead of us; we're crossing Lalande C.
04 08 18 03,LMP,Okay [comma]  Fredo. We're coming over Turner Crater. It looks just like on the map as we approach the site
04 08 18 36,LMP,They don't seem quite as long as on the map [comma]  Fredo
04 08 20 27,CDR,Okay [comma]  Houston.- We've spotted the general - the general area of the landing site from Rina Parry on in. We didn't spot Cone Crater on this pass [comma]  however.
04 08 20 52,LMP,And [comma]  Fredo [comma]  as we come up on Lansberg here [comma]  it's -the terminator's running right across it. And it is a big one. It really has some - a steep rim -or rather a high rim [comma]  a very noticeably high rim for here - from - from here. And it's right -the terminator goes right through it.
04 08 44 22,CDR,Go ahead [comma]  Houston.
04 08 44 36,LMP,Was that for Antares?
04 08 44 42,LMP,Okay. We'll get it going around the corner.
04 08 45 00,LMP,Hey [comma]  Houston [comma]  clarify -
04 08 45 39,CMP,Kitty Hawk [comma]  Antares.
04 08 45 41,LMP,You're loud and clear.
04 08 45 43,CMP,Okay ...
04 08 45 47,LMP,Okay. And you have it.
04 09 07 31,CMP,Okay [comma]  Antares. How do you read on VOX?
04 09 07 37,CDR,Okay. Loud and clear.
04 09 07 38,LMP,Loud and clear. Tape recorder's on [comma]  S-band - ...
04 09 08 03,???,Houston [comma]  I have you locked up on the steerable.
04 09 08 15,LMP,Okay [comma]  let me keep you honest [comma]  Al.
04 09 08 28,LMP,I ... hold off on it until you do.
04 09 08 32,CDR,Give me about 5 seconds [comma]  Stu. I need another 5 seconds.
04 09 08 38,CMP,
04 09 08 41,LMP,***' Okay [comma]  BI0MED *** LEFT- [comma]  PCM *** HI.
04 09 08 47,CMP,... zero. Will you be ready to go at 5? Are you ready [comma]  Al?
04 09 08 55,CDR,We're ready. Go.
04 09 09 01,CMP,And you're hanging on the end of the probe. We'll wait until motions damp here [comma]  Okay. We seem real steady. I'm going to back off from you.
04 09 09 15,CDR,Okay. Very good.
04 09 09 28,CDR,Okay. We had a normal undocking [comma]  Houston.
04 09 09 36,LMP,Okay. DEAD BAND [comma]  MIN; VERB 77; go to P00.
04 09 10 12,LMP,Stu [comma]  are you going to be able to burn on time? Okay. We don't see you [comma]  but I guess we will when you light off.
04 09 11 03,LMP,Give us a 15-second warning if you - can [comma]  Stu.
04 09 11 14,CMP,About 35 seconds. Have 30. EMS [comma]  NORMAL.
04 09 11 21,LMP,Great [comma]  we're watching. We're with you. Good; keep going.
04 09 11 59,CMP,Okay.
04 09 12 00,CMP,SHUTDOWN.
04 09 12 02,LMP,Gee [comma]  we sure didn't see a thing [comma]  Stuart. Oh [comma]  I just saw a flash up there. His tracking light [comma] 
04 09 12 19,CDR,Huh? See his tracking light on or something?
04 09 12 28,LMP,Saw a couple of flashes.
04 09 12 31,CDR,Yes - -
04 09 12 49,LMP,You have a mighty invisible engine [comma]  Stu. It didn't have anything we could see at all from here.
04 09 16 42,CMP,Okay [comma]  Ed. The burn went off. Surprisingly enough [comma]  it was 2-foot-per-second overburn; I turned it back to - to one and ...
04 09 19 57,LMP,That's interesting [comma]  Stu; we never saw your burn at all; but at the same time [comma]  when you burst into sunlight [comma]  you were right ahead of us. We were pointed right at you [comma]  but we didn't see a thing.
04 09 20 47,LMP,Stu [comma]  we ha - have your - your apogee/perigee numbers for comparison [comma]  if you'd like them.
04 09 20 53,CMP,Okay. I've got a 53.9 by 56.0 [comma] 
04 09 21 00,CDR,Okay [comma]  we're showing 56.1 hy 63.5.
04 09 21 07,LMP,Good enough.
04 10 43 44,CMP,... l/200th - and [comma]  I guess [comma]  fire a frame [comma]  remove the magazine [comma]  look at the slit [comma]  see if it's an inch from the side rail - and I guess I see some sprockets in there [comma]  and then - if it is 1 inch [comma]  I'll put the magazine back in  [comma]  fire another frame [comma]  and check that the slit is still there. If it's out in the center somewhere - Well [comma]  then we've got big problems.
04 11 28 20,CDR,Go ahead [comma]  Houston.
04 11 28 45,CDR,Okay [comma]  stand by. Let's get locked up on the main lobe [comma]  Fred.
04 11 29 08,CDR,And [comma]  in the meantime [comma]  do you still read me?
04 11 29 15,CDR,Okay [comma]  ASCENT BATs went on at 108:01:45.
04 11 29 33,CDR,
04 11 29 35,LMP,Okay.
04 13 38 11,CMP,Houston [comma]  14 [comma]  How do you read? ...
04 13 38 30,CMP,Well [comma]  how're the troops of Antares making out? Do you have an estimate on the landing spot yet [comma]  Ren?
04 13 38 51,CMP,How far from the spot? Did they - they come right in on the first pick?
04 13 39 05,CMP,Roger. Are they right on the target?
04 13 39 26,CMP,Oh [comma]  okay.
04 13 43 41,CMP,Houston [comma]  14 - Kitty Hawk.
04 13 43 51,CMP,Hey [comma]  Ron [comma]  got any word on how the low-altitude pass on 11-1 and the high-altitude compare?
04 13 44 11,CMP,Okay.
04 13 44 36,CMP,Okay.
04 14 14 04,CMP,All right [comma]  Ron. I tried to change the camera and put the sextant on and take a look at the site.
04 14 40 44,CMP,And [comma]  Houston; Kitty Hawk.
04 14 40 51,CMP,Hey [comma]  Ron. Has - Is somebody thinking up an - any words about our Descartes photography? Does it look like the Hycon's wiped out; are we going to do the C0AS or - Any decision on that?
04 14 41 13,CMP,Okay.
04 14 41 20,CMP,And - somebody ...? E'oes it look like the Hycon's wiped out?
04 15 15 35,CMP,Left [comma]  left [comma]  and .. .
04 15 18 31,CMP,That son of a bitch.
04 15 21 43,CMP,Oks.y [comma]  we're getting ready to start the zero-phase observations on target 1. I'm now running - DET was started at - T-start at 111:59:43 and I'm waiting to try again.
04 15 22 20,CMP,First target at 8:07.
04 15 23 26,CMP,... 5.
04 15 23 43,CMP,Okay [comma]  starting at 9:05.
04 15 23 58,CMP,... yet. If not ... -
04 15 24 29,CMP,And approaching 4 minutes.
04 15 25 02,CMP,Okay [comma]  there are my targets. Targets A [comma]  B [comma]  C.
04 15 25 26,CMP,Okay [comma]  standing by to start the time. That's 5 minutes.
04 15 25 43,CMP,MARK [comma]  Intervalometer going. Okay [comma]  I have targets A [comma]  B [comma]  and C. C will be the first into the zero-phase. Picked them up without any difficulty at all.... anyway. Intervalometer ... again.
04 15 26 14,CMP,And A [comma]  B - Okay [comma]  looks like C is Just about ir. zero-phase now. And I really have lost C at zero-phase. That's a pretty good picture there. As it moved into zero-phase [comma]  it was essentially wiped out.
04 15 26 33,CMP,Now it's coming back out again.
04 15 26 46,CMP,Okay [comma]  B. You just almost lose B going to zero-phase. I can tell where it is by the other craters -pointing at it. But [comma]  if you didn't have that help [comma]  it'd be tough.
04 15 27 12,CMP,And now we're going into - A's going ir. toward zero-phase. In fact [comma]  I'm quite surprised how washed out they do become. I had anticipated I would be able to stay with them a little more than that.
04 15 27 33,CMP,Well [comma]  we're going - It's 7 minutes [comma]  so A will be moving towards zero-phase. And it's pretty much the same story. Zero-phase is that - is that condition - it - it really - Kind of surprising how it - how it wipes it out [comma]  I think you can tell the general area [comma]  on B in particular [comma]  that with the lead-in [comma]  you could - you could find it. With -with B [comma]  it's pretty much totally wiped out at -at zero-phase [comma]  and A had a little better landmarks around it.
04 15 28 25,CMP,Okay [comma]  I'm switching to second target new. .And A shows up extremely well. B is - you can see 3 here now. It's just starting to go into - into zero-phase as it moves on up. But B is a - 3's a mighty rough target [comma]  even without zero-phase [comma] 
04 15 29 09,CMP,And you can - you can hang onto A pretty well. B - B [comma]  just - I just didn't find long enough to give a good - a good impression on that one - on that one [comma]  I guess [comma]  overall [comma]  I'd rate it - at -
04 15 29 47,CMP,But A in - in target 2 [comma]  you can almost hang onto B in target 1 -
04 15 30 08,CMP,Now [comma]  of course [comma]  target 2-B is hard to find even under good conditions [comma]  so - but it'd be impossible at the - at the zero-phase point. And I'm going to quit now [comma]  and I'll give you a little summary here. I'll rate these as I - by the criteria that we set up. Okay [comma]  on target 1 [comma]  I'd rate C -
04 15 30 45,CMP,Okay [comma]  I'm going to turn off the intervalometer. No. Let it run for another 20 seconds. But I - I'm so far out [comma]  I - I really can't - It says you got to let the DAC run until 12:24. Okay. All right [comma]  I'd rate - I'd rate C in area 1 - I'd rate C as low; B as medium [comma]  and A is - is low; 2-A [comma]  medium; and B [comma]  very low.
04 15 31 52,CMP,I think what would really help you is - is relief around [comma]  like C was out pretty flat. And then [comma]  when It got zero-phase [comma]  it pretty well wiped it out. But - okay [comma]  and on my mark [comma]  the DAC will be going off. Stand by.
04 15 32 11,CMP,MARK. I let it slip one.
04 15 32 13,CMP,MARK. There [comma]  that was the last picture on targets 1 and 2 [comma] 
04 15 32 21,CMP,And just a little more on the debriefing [comma]  I think if there's some relief around [comma]  it helps you quite a bit. Like C was out flat [comma]  and you'd lose it. B [comma]  I had the good chain of craters going into it [comma]  so you could pick that up [comma]  and - and A [comma]  also. It was the landmarks that really - really had you pick it up. But when it's out flat [comma]  it just washed it out completely.
04 15 33 08,CMP,Okay [comma]  Houston [comma]  Kitty Hawk [comma] 
04 15 33 59,CMP,344.7 [comma]  340.9 [comma]  ...
04 15 34 17,CMP,Hello [comma]  Houston. This is Kitty Hawk.
04 15 36 57,CMP,Kitty Hawk. How do you read?
04 15 37 07,CMP,Well ... I never saw B at all [comma]  and A ... pick up ... zero-phase [comma]  B was just completely wiped out.... clue is ... some relief by you [comma]  even in zero-phase ... best of the three . .  [comma]  pretty well hang ... and A was about ...
04 15 38 31,CMP,Well ...
04 15 38 38,CMP,Okay ... on the tape ... this other ...
04 15 40 50,CMP,... loud and clear ...?
04 15 41 09,CMP,Okay [comma]  you've always been loud and clear ...
04 15 41 30,CMP,Okay [comma]  Ron; are you going to let the tape run for the ... next sighting?
04 15 46 55,CMP,And [comma]  Houston; Kitty Hawk [comma]  Do you want me to terminate the charge on B and start one on Able?
04 15 47 10,CMP,Okay.
04 15 55 36,CMP,Okay [comma]  thank you.
04 16 00 36,CMP,Okay [comma]  I'll do that.
04 16 00 56,CMP,And stand by.
04 16 00 59,CMP,MARK. Camera's running. Five minutes. Okay [comma]  and now I can pick up to Ptolemaeus [comma]  to Ptolemaeus A [comma]  and I can pick up Bright Crater. Yes [comma]  even at this low elevation [comma]  targets A and B show up real well. The trouble of it is [comma]  it doesn't look to me like the camera's on target [comma]  but - They're a little too far to the left. But [comma]  anyway [comma]  I can't see targets -both targets A and B by themselves. I guess I used that little bright crater up by B [comma]  maybe as a gouge [comma]  but it showed up pretty well. There's no problem on acquisition [comma]  Houston. Appear to just be getting better as I - as I come up in elevation. Of course [comma]  I guess it wouldn't surprise me to come up cere and see that I picked up the wrong target.
04 16 02 18,CMP,I really don't think this camera's pointed right [comma]  Ron. It's boresighted right down - looks like the junction between Ptolemaeus and Alphonsus. But [comma]  anyway [comma]  my - both targets A and B - had no trouble acquiring these and no trouble sticking with them. Even A is the - the hardest; it's not quite as straight [comma]  Now B had a - had a bright rim and showed up at the very start of the - of the observation. A is - is a little more subdued [comma]  but it was quite easy to pick up and hang on to. And that's - that's really a no-sweat on - on this one [comma]  much - much easier than the - those on the backside. In fact [comma]  I rated some of those with zero. And I'd have to give them up on - on both these targets - Cone Crater.
04 16 03 34,CMP,And the hard part is over [comma]  once you acquire them at that low elevation. In fact [comma]  the elevation is as difficult as - any sort of Sun problem [comma]  That would be here [comma]  as we go - go towards the zero-phase; I guess it's probably still about 08:40 and I'd guess about 40 minutes to go. It's still hanging in there right now. No - no problem at all. Particularly B [comma]  it's - it hasn't the - the bright surface on the center across the crater -that makes it that much easier. Let's see [comma]  I can see the zero-phase. And I guess the camera was pointing at it as we get up here closer. And I can see zero-phase now [comma]  approaching target A [comma]  so this should be a - a good test. Been no problem to acquire up to now.
04 16 04 39,CMP,There's zero-phase just about on A [comma]  and the camera took the picture. Okay [comma]  we went through zero-phase on A with - with no problem - hanging on to the landmark itself.
04 16 04 56,CMP,Zero-phase is passing B - at this time. And it [comma]  again [comma]  is definitely no problem.
04 16 05 12,CMP,And now [comma]  as we come cut of the - out of the zero-phase [comma]  it gets constantly better [comma]  of course. And I'll be switching targets at 09:58. It's 09:24 now. Both targets at Ptolemaeus are ready to pick up. Of course [comma]  it's no problem now picking those up.
04 16 05 59,CMP,Okay [comma]  we're going to switch now and take a look at - at Parry. And - actually [comma]  this one here is again extremely easy. You can pick up both -both targets A and B as soon as you see it [comma]  r.c sweat. I think you'd use the - of course [comma]  you'd use the - Parry and Parry M to guide you into the area. But once you got into the area [comma]  why. A and B just stand out so good that [comma]  here again [comma]  it's -primarily - it's - the elevation angle helps [comma]  because we're up a little higher and - and [comma]  also [comma]  the bright crater stages show up extremely well. It's like you got the crater with a bright rim. It really helps with low elevation.
04 16 07 08,CMP,In fact [comma]  zero-phase is approaching - approaching the area now. And both targets are - are hanging in there .
04 16 07 22,CiIF,Camera went just right at zero-phase. And here again [comma]  it was extremely easy to recognize the targets - this would be - really [comma]  again [comma]  a nosweat proposition to pick the targets up. Zero-phase - really doesn't have that big an effect on -on these two targets.
04 16 08 10,CMP,Okay. And now [comma]  I'll stop and rate them here; seems like a good time [comma]  I guess target A was extremely good all the way along. Target B [comma]  also [comma]  was quite easy to recognize. But here again [comma]  prim - primarily because of the - of the Sun shining on the - on the crater rim. An older [comma]  more diffuse crater would be more difficult to pick up [comma]  but with those -with those bright - bright rims - bright side to -both targets A and B [comma]  it was really no problem. Okay [comma]  And my last picture [comma]  I will give you a mark. When it goes off [comma]  it'll be a little past 12:32.
04 16 09 21,CMP,And -
04 16 09 22,CMP,MARK. Last picture on target 4 [comma]  Camera is off.
04 16 11 11,CMP,Okay. I'll get to moving here [comma]  and then I'll pick me up at - oh [comma]  maybe between 50 and 58. First frame number should be eight.
04 16 13 42,CMP,Okay. Just a couple of more comments while they're fresh in my mind. I think there was a big difference between the frontside and the backside passes  [comma]  and that's primarily because [comma]  on the - on the front side [comma]  we're picking out craters that were out in a flat area. And they had the rim up behind them to - to guide you in on it. I think you'd - you'd use the - the large [comma]  gross features to get you pointed in the right area of the - of the mare or the flat surface [comma]  and - and then [comma]  the - the rim of the crater would - would - would show up. And you could guide in on it. Both those craters at Parry were quite fresh; they had a bright rim [comma]  The target A in the Ptolemaeus was fairly subdued - but still [comma]  yet [comma]  it did show up [comma]  and you could hold on to it right through zero-phase. So [comma]  let me see [comma]  I' c. rate -
04 16 15 16,CMP,I'c. rate both - both targets 3 and 4 - high.
04 16 39 07,CMP,A-3 [comma]  C-4 [comma]  B-3. A-3. C-4 - Okay [comma]  Ron. A-3 [comma]  C-4 [comma]  B-3 [comma]  D-4.
04 16 39 57,CMP,Oks.y [comma]  Make sure she's running.
04 16 41 40,CMP,Verify ...
04 16 42 07,CMP,Configure camera - the right one [comma]  ...
04 16 45 09,CMP,Okay [comma]  On the zodiacal light : The - after the first 20-second frame [comma]  I got out of shut - sync on the shutter [comma]  and I fired off two more frames before I got down to - to 10 seconds. And then I went to 10 seconds and then 5 seconds [comma]  in order.
04 16 45 55,CMP,And I was also a little late getting started. I started at about 6 minutes [comma]  instead of 5. And I'll get these others on time here; 8:20 [comma]  we're looking for.
04 16 46 23,CMP,Open.
04 16 46 36,CMP,27 [comma]  37. Okay [comma]  three - three on 10 -
04 16 46 59,CMP,Okay. Two on 5 ?
04 16 47 08,CMP,Okay. The 8:20 went just as advertised; 20 [comma]  10 [comma]  and 5. So far [comma]  the only thing extra was the -one on the - first one.
04 16 47 50,CMP,16  [comma]  8  [comma]  and 40n 11: Uo.
04 16 48 29,CMP,11:40 [comma]  16 [comma]  8 [comma]  and 4.
04 16 48 37,CMP,11: 40  [comma]  16 [comma]  8 [comma]  and 4.
04 16 49 37,CMP,Record 11:40; 28 [comma]  29 - 16 ...
04 16 49 58,CMP,Okay [comma]  I'm in sync. Okay [comma]  next one's 8.
04 16 50 09,CMP,Eleven [comma]  okay [comma]  at 24 [comma] 
04 16 50 21,CMP,Okay [comma]  I got out of sync. I'm going to repeat the 40n the 11:40 - plus. Okay [comma] 
04 16 50 36,CMP,Okay [comma]  That's got it [comma]  That was an extra frame on the 11:40 sequence.
04 16 51 29,CMP,Aaah (sigh).
04 16 53 15,CMP,13 [comma]  14 [comma]  15:00. Okay. I'm In sync; 16 [comma]  8 [comma]  and 4 [comma] 
04 16 53 32,CMP,Okay.
04 16 53 40,CMP,And there's number 4. Okay. There's two extra ones here. Let me give you another good 4.
04 16 53 53,CMP,Okay. That takes care of the 15:00 [comma]  with two extra shots in there.
04 16 56 12,CMP,...  [comma]  4  [comma]  and 2 [comma] 
04 16 56 37,CMP,Okay [comma]  I'm in sync; there's the Moon. Should be ir. sync. Okay [comma]  I'm in sync.... Okay. We have 8 [comma]  4 [comma]  and 2.
04 16 59 34,CMP,21:40  [comma]  one frame at 8 [comma] 
04 17 00 17,CMP,Okay. I took an extra 4 there [comma]  also. I wasn't sure whether the thruster fired.
04 17 01 30,CMP,Okay [comma]  25:00; 4 [comma]  2 [comma]  and 1.
04 17 05 36,CMP,I'm looking for 29:00 now.
04 17 06 29,CMP,7 [comma]  8 [comma]  9.
04 17 06 34,CMP,3 [comma]  4 [comma]  5 [comma]  6 [comma]  7 [comma]  3 [comma]  9 [comma]  and 10.
04 17 06 45,CMP,3 [comma]  4 [comma]  5.
04 18 41 44,CMP,... And it's not in here. And it's not in here [comma]  either.
04 18 42 42,CMP,22.
04 18 43 01,CMP,
04 18 45 01,CMP,... my butt out.
04 19 34 18,CMP,Houston [comma]  ... Kitty Hawk.
04 19 52 42,CMP,Okay. Can you read [comma]  Ron?
04 20 02 44,CC,And if you have a free minute [comma]  we would like some commentary on the depth of the MET tracks.
04 20 07 38,CC,Roger. Out.

04 20 35 34,CMP,No [comma]  I didn't get that yet. Do you want to let it run on through until I come out AOS [comma]  or do you want - When do you want that terminated?

05 11 58 05,CC,Okay. Give me a call when you get there [comma]  and I'll start the timing.

05 12 00 50,CC,Okay. I got all - all readings [comma]  Ed.
05 12 00 58,CC,Roger. High scale.
05 19 03 02,CMP,Okay. We're getting ready to start the zero-phase observations on targets 5 and 6. We're a minute and a half past the T-start time; waiting for 5 minutes - to put on the camera.
05 19 03 25,CMP,Passed over target 1.
05 19 03 36,CMP,Sure is a lot of difference with this low Sun than there was yesterday. Kind of amazing about C; how - in particular [comma]  how it - You really lose it at zero-phase [comma] 
05 19 05 20,CMP,Well [comma]  tell you what. At this low - Sun angle [comma]  you can see a B on target 2 [comma]  but it's still - still almost unidentifiable; that's just really a tough target. A shows up real well at this low Sun angle You'd be hard put to call which crater was B - at any Sun angle.
05 19 06 02,CMP,Okay [comma]  At 04:20 [comma]  turning on the DAC here shortly. Camera ...
05 19 11 13,CMP,And I lost them all - So on that one [comma]  at the switch point [comma]  I could not pick up target A at all. It was just too subdued. B was easy to pick up [comma]  and 0 also. C - C was - was very easy to pick up. Going through zero-phase [comma]  B was completely wiped out; A [comma]  I never did have to start with [comma]  so it was wiped out; and C - C held through zero-phase and reasonably well; but as it got further on up [comma]  it [comma]  too [comma]  got pretty well wiped out. I think it's the same bit of being on the - being on the backside. You Just - The terrain is - You don't have the flat mare surface to give you the relief that - that you need to pick out - to pick out the targets. It's - what - very little contrast In albedo [comma]  and -you - you Just don't have the - the ability to see the darks and lights like we did on the frontside pass yesterday. And [comma]  I guess [comma]  in summary now [comma]  for targets 3 - very easy to pick up at the time I picked them up; of course [comma]  the Sun was low on them. And I'm going to turn off this ... test lever under panel 18. Okay [comma]  I'll leave it on a little longer and debrief onto the tape. A - A [comma]  B [comma]  and C on target 3 picked up very easily. Saw them into zero-phase; surpri - B is a fairly shallow crater [comma]  but it even held up as good as C. I'd put 3 and C both completely wiped out at zero-phase. A held to zero-phase; but then [comma]  as it went on up [comma]  you surely couldn't have picked it up - by itself [comma]  if you didn't know the relation to some other terrain. All three of those were - Once you're well past zero-phase [comma]  it'd be a rather marginal target. And [comma]  on target 6 [comma]  I never got A at all - it was already wiped out. B went real fast in zero-phase approach. C [comma]  you could still identify after zero-phase [comma]  but Just because you knew it was there. And then [comma]  it
05 19 15 31,CMP,Okay. Let me see if I can pick up the high gain [comma] 
05 19 15 48,CMP,It ought to be getting better real fast.
05 19 15 57,CMP,Okay. And stand by Just 1; I'll make - I want to mate a couple of notes here. And - -
