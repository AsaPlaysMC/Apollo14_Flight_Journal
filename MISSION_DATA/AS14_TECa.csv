04|02|36|13|CMP|Good morning, Houston. 14 here.
04|02|36|17|cc|Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. Roger. Good evening, Stu.
04|02|36|26|CMP|Good evening? It's good morning, Bruce baby.
04|02|36|30|CC|Roger. How'd you all sleep?
04|02|36|47|CMP|And Bruce, I've got a crew status report for you.
04|02|36|50|CC|Okay. Go ahead with your crew status report.
04|02|36|56|CMP|Okay. Al: 6 hours of sleep, dosimeter, 16048; Ed: 6 hours, 01046; and 6 hours, 05038.
04|02|37|12|CC|Okay. Understand 6 hours of sleep each, 16o48, 01046, and 05038. Over.
04|02|37|27|CMP|That's affirmative.
04|02|37|30|CC|14, this is Houston. At this time, we would like the CMP and the LMP to swap dosimeters. The LMP dosimeter is inoperative, and we would like to have two active dosimeters on the lunar surface. Over.
04|02|37|47|CMP|Okay. We'll do that.
04|02|38|16|CC|And, 14; this is Houston. Would you confirm a negative presleep status report. Over.
04|02|38|28|CMP|That's affirmative. We went to bed all healthy, no medication, and we're getting up the same way.
o4|02|38|35|CC|Roger. Out.
o4|02|38|54|cc|Okay. When you're interested, I have about four or five general information-type items to pass up to you all.
04|02|39|06|CMP|Okay, Bruce. This is something - we should all be on the headset for? If it is, we should Just wait a few minutes.
04|02|39|14|CC|Yes. Why don't we do that? There's no great rush in any of them, but we've got 24 minutes to LOS. And just let me know when you're ready.
04|02|39|26|CMP|Okay. I’ll take a consumables update, anytime you've got it. We'll get that out of the way, if you want to give it to me now.
04|02|39|33|CC|Okay, I'll have the consumables update for you momentarily. In the meantime, we'd like you to read out the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA meters and the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA knobs. It has not been switching to NARROW BEAM at AOS. We're not sure why, right now. We's like to leave the configuration as is and get those read-outs. Over.
04|02|4o|10|CMP|Okay, Bruce, the -
o4|02|4o|15|IMP|Bruce, this is Ed. I got my biomed on, and I got the sensor corrected. Have the medics take a look at it while you're talking to Stu, please.
o4|02|4o|23|CC|I understand you have your biomed hooked up, and the sensor is connected, and you'd like the medics to look at it.
04|02|4o|30|IMP|That's affirm.
04|02|4o|32|CC|We're in LOW BIT RATE right now, Ed. You'll have to hold on a minute.
04|02|40|42|CMP|Okay, Bruce, the read-outs on the PITCH meter is 50 degrees, on the YAW meter is 270, on the knob, it's set at 35; and the - PITCH - YAW knob is set ? at 275-
04|02|4i|06|CC|Okay, Stu, on pitch, is that plus or minus? Over.
04|02|4i|12|CMP|Oh, sorry about that. Both are minuses.
04|02|4i|15|CC|Okay. Meter: PITCH, minus 50; YAW, 270; knob, minus 35 and 275. Over.
04|02|4i|27|CMP|That's affirmative.
04|02|4l|29|CC|Okay; coming at you with a consumables update. Over.
04|02|4i|36|CMP|And let her rip.
04|02|4i|38|CC|At a GET of 99 hours even; RCS total, 74 percent; quads in order, 73, 75, 73, 75; hydrogen, 65, 65; oxygen, 85, 83, 31. Over.
04|02|42|10|CMP|Roger. Copy the GET 99 hours; RCS total, 74; quads, 73, 75, 73, 75; hydrogen, 65, 65; 0 , 85, 83, 31.
04|02|42|27|CC|Roger, out.
04|02|42|43|LMP|Houston, 14.
04|02|42|44|CC|Go ahead, Ed.
04|02|42|50|LMP|Are you going to switch over to HIGH BIT RATE so you can look at this? I'd like to go ahead and start suiting up.
04|02|42|55|CC|Stand by.
04|02|43|17|CC|Apollo 14, this is Houston. We request HIGH GAIN ANTENNA SERVO ELECTRONICS to SECONDARY. Over.
04|02|43|28|LMP|Okay. ... - -
04|02|43|29|CMP|Okay; going to SECONDARY.
04|02|45|11|CC|Apollo 14, this is Houston. Request S-BAND NORMAL, TRANSPONDER, SECONDARY. Over.
04|02|45|22|IMP|Roger. TRANSPONDER, SECONDARY.
04|02|46|08|CC|Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read?
04|02|46|i4|LMP|Loud and clear. How me?
04|02|46|15|CC|Roger; reading you the same.
04|02|47|00|LMP|Houston, 14.
04|02|47|03|CC|Go ahead, 14.
04|02|47|07|IMP|I'd appreciate an answer on your intentions relative to the sensor.
04|02|47|11|CC|Okay, Ed. Relative to the sensor, we require a HIGH BIT RATE down here in order for the surgeon to get any biomed telemetry. We're attempting to get HIGH BIT RATE at the present time, as evidenced by our request for SECONDARY ELECTRONICS on the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA and the SECONDARY TRANSPONDER, We'll let you know just as soon as we can press on. Perhaps, in the meantime, you could tell us which sensor you think was giving you the problem and what you've done in the meantime to it. Over.
04|02|47|43|LMP|Okay, the lower sternum sensor was leaking, and we replaced it last evening, and it seemed to be the only one that had a chance to he in had shape.
o4|02|47|59|CC|We copy. Out.
o4|02|48|01|LMP|... to be the only one that looked like it might be ...
04|02|48|03|CC|Roger out. And -
04|02|48|4i|CC|Apollo 14, this is Houston. Request HIGH GAIN, ELECTRONIC - HIGH GAIN ANTENNA, SERVO ELECTRONICS, POWER, PRIMARY; S-BAND NORMAL, TRANSPONDER to PRIMARY, and go to TRACK mode, MANUAL. Over.
04|02|49|47|IMP|Houston, lH. Do you read, now?
04|02|49|49|CC|14. This is Houston. Roger. We're reading you about 5 by 4. Over.
04|02|49|58|LMP|Okay. I've given - given you PRIMARY, SERVO ELECTRONICS; PRIMARY, TRANSPONDER; and what else did you want?
04|02|50|o4|CC|Roger. We want to go back to TRACK mode, MANUAL; and we'll use the positions that you have set on the PITCH and YAW dials at the present time.
04|02|50|15|IMP|Okay.
o4|02|50|30|LMP|... MANUAL ...
04|02|50|34|CC|Okay. And reading you about 4 by 2 at the present time. Stand by.
04|02|51|28|LMP|Houston. 14. Do you read?
04|02|51|31|CC|Roger, Ed. We're reading you. We'd like you to do a normal manual acquisition, switching back the WIDE BEAM and then coming on over.
04|02|51|42|IMP|Okay.
04|02|53|03|LMP|Houston, I have you on AUTO and NARROW again, and I cannot seem to get the signal strength above about the three-quarter mark.
04|02|53|14|CC|Roger. I'm reading you with a good bit of noise in the background, Ed.
04|02|54|09|CC|Apollo 14, this is Houston. We request you attempt acquisition again using the normal manual procedures. Over.
04|02|54|20|LMP|Roger. Roger.
o4|02|56|09|CC|Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. We suggest HIGH GAIN ANTENNA angles of PITCH, minus 25; YAW, 280. I say it again: PITCH, minus 25; YAW, 280. Over.
04|02|56|52|CC|Apollo 14, this is Houston. We suggest HIGH GAIN ANTENNA; PITCH, minus 25; that is minus 25; YAW, 280; YAW, 280. Over.
04|02|59|30|CC|Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you - -
04|02|59|32|LMP|Houston, Apollo lU. How do you read?
04|02|59|34|CC|Roger. Loud and clear, now, Ed. We've got 4 - -
04|02|59|37|IMP|Go ahead, Bruce. You're loud and clear.
04|02|59|33|CC|- - minutes to LOS.
o4|02|59|49|CC|Apollo 14 - -
04|02|59|50|LMP|Go ahead.
o4|02|59|51|CC|Apollo 14, Stu. We've got 4 minutes until LOS. I have a four-step procedure for testing the lunar topo camera, if you are ready to listen and copy?
o4|03|00|06|CMP|Stand hy 1, Bruce.
o4|03|00|08|CC|Roger. We're standing hy.
04|03|00|24|CMP|Okay, go ahead Bruce,
04|03|00|27|CC|Okay. With respect to the Hycon, we think this may be a low-current problem. We've been able to duplicate most of your symptoms down here in Building 4 with the other model. What we'd like you to do is - step 1: disconnect all power connectors, inspect, and reconnect. Over.
04|03|01|02|CMP|Okay. This baby reads disconnect all power connectors, inspect, and reconnect. And I guess -you know, we - we do that when we put it in and out, if I understand your step right. I mean, they're all disconnected. I guess you mean just look at the pins and so forth. Amplify that just a little bit, Bruce.
04|03|01|23|CC|That's correct. We'd just like you to inspect for bent pins, any sort of damage, cracked insulators; anything like that you can find in error. Break, break, for Ed. We are unable to verify your biomed harness at this time. We'd like you to change out biomed harness. Do not suit up, and we'll check it over at AOS, next pass. Over.
04|03|01|48|IMP|Roger. Understand. Change out the biomed harness, and do not suit up.
04|03|01|52|CC|Roger. You can - you can suit up partially - -
04|02|01|55|IMP|Be advised that - okay, understand. Be advised that the HIGH GAIN, I've tried manual procedures and about three-quarters of that signal strength I can get.
04|03|02|02|CC|Roger. We copy on the HIGH GAIN. You can suit up partially if you want to take the risk of having to unsuit a little ways. Break, break, for Stu. Step 2: we'd like you to switch non-essential power to opposite MAIN DC BUS, that is, from B to A or A to B, whatever you were on last time. Step 3: reset control box film counter to zero; shutter speed to l/200th of a second; with magazine removed, visually examine the shutter-curtain slit position. If the slit is visible, it should not be more than 1 inch from the magazine guide rail. Examine sprocket area for visible tears. Step 4: install magazine Whiskey and actuate single frame. Remove magazine and verify slit is not more than 1 inch from magazine guide rail, if visible. Thirty seconds to LOS. I repeat, switch from nonessential power from BUS B to A or A to B, opposite what you had. Reset control box film counter to zero and shutter to l/200th; with magazine removed, visually examine shutter-curtain slit position; if visible, slit should not be more than 1 inch frcm magazine guide rail. Examine sprocket area for visible tears; install magazine Whiskey and actuate single frame. Remove magazine and verify slit is not more than 1 inch from magazine guide rail. We'll talk, to you on AOS next time on the results.
04|03|29|0||BEGIN LUNAR REV 10
o4|03|53|16|CC|Apollo 14. Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
04|03|53|24|CMP|Read you 5 square, Bruce. How me?
o4|03|53|27|CC|Roger, Stu. We're reading you with a good bit of background noise. We've got a few things to pass up to you, if you're ready to listen.
04|03|53|43|CMP|Okay. Stand by just 1.
04|03|53|45|CC|Okay. In the meantime, Stu, for you or Ed, we'd like you to try a normal acquisition again on the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA and, if that's NO GO, try acquisition in MANUAL and MEDIUM BEAM width. Over.
04|03|54|05|CMP|Okay. Let me get down here and give it a go.
04|03|55|19|CMP|Houston, how do you read Apollo 14?
04|03|55|25|CC|Okay. Loud and clear, 14.
o4|03|55|31|CMP|Okay, Bruce; doesn't seem to be doing too good. Still can't get the lock up solid all the way. I'm in AUTO and MEDIUM now, and that's where you want it?
04|03|55|45|CC|That's affirmative, 14. And we're checking out Ed's biomed.
04|03|55|54|CMP|Okay.
04|03|56|03|CC|Okay. In the meantime, an item of general interest on your orbital status. You started out somewhat high and are decaying at a slightly greater rate than predicted. However, the altitude at PDI will still be about 46,000 feet. That's 46,000 feet or 8.3 nautical miles; so your pericynthion's still good. Over.
04|03|56|34|CMP|Okay. Sounds like good planning.
04|03|56|59|CC|And, Apollo 14; Stu, map update REV 11, if you're ready.
o4|03|57|07|CMP|Negative. Stand by 1.
04|03|57|22|CC|Apollo 14; Ed, this is Houston. You're GO to commence suiting up.
04|03|57|32|IMP|Roger, Roger. Thank you, Bruce.
04|03|57|34|CC|Biomed's looking good. Apollo 14; Ed, this is Houston. Can you monitor, just for a minute, discussion on the ascent batteries.
04|03|57|51|IMP|Roger. I'm on. Go ahead.
04|03|57|53|CC|14, Houston. Our feeling right now is that this is a single-cell problem in ascent battery number 5- If one cell were shorted out entirely and completely discharged, this would drop your terminal voltage by 1.8 volts. The expected voltage, open circuit, at activation is greater than 35-3. I say again, it’s greater than 35*3. However, the open circuit voltage will not be our criterion. We will use the Delta in voltage between BATs 5 and 6 underload to evaluate battery 5. If there is more than a 1.8-volt Delta between 5 and 6 - that is, if it should turn out that you have a problem with more than one cell, then battery 5 will be NO GO. Over.
04|03|58|55|IMP|Understand, Houston, that if, in subsequent checks, we have more than one cell that shows up bad, battery 5 will be NO GO.
04|03|59|06|CC|Roger.
04|03|59|11|CMP|Okay. And I'm ready for the REV 11 update, Bruce.
04|03|59|15|CC|14, Houston. REV 11, 180 degrees, 102:03:40. Understand you don't need LOS or AOS; they're close to nominal.
04|03|59|46|CC|Apollo 14, this is Houston. I've got a lot of noise in the background now. Did you copy the time for 180, 102:03:40? Over.
04|04|01|01|CC|Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read now? Over.
04|04|01|38|cc|Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read?
04|o4|01|44|CMP|Loud and clear, Bruce.
04|04|01|46|cc|Okay. We're reading you again, Stu. We'd like you to go with MANUAL and MEDIUM BEAM width, please.
04|04|01|55|CMP|Okay.
04|o4|02|26|CMP|Okay, Bruce. The antenna seemed to oscillate a little bit, there. It's steadied out now with a reasonably good signal - -
04|o4|02|31|CC|Say, that looks beautiful. That looks beautiful, Stu.
04|04|02|39|CMP|Okay - -
04|04|02|40|CC|Stu, did you copy the time for 180-degree meridian, 102:03:40?
o4|04|02|51|CMP|That's affirmative; 102:03:40.
04|04|02|54|CC|Roger. Were you able to run through the LTC camera checkout procedures 1 through 4, or we fade out on you before you got them?
04|04|03|o4|CMP|That's negative on being able to run through them. I didn’t even begin to get them copied, Bruce. I guess - I need to - What time frame are you thinking of me troubleshooting that one? Is that something that we need to worry about right now?
04|04|03|18|CC|No, we'll hold off on that.
04|04|03|43|CC|Okay, 14. On the subject of the docking probe situation, for undocking, we anticipate a normal undocking sequence, that is, extension followed by release of the LM. If there should be no release at this time, we request that you hold the RELEASE position of the EXTEND/RELEASE switch and both vehicles thrust minus-X for 3 seconds, and then RELEASE on the - or return the switch to center. Over.
04|04|04|28|CMP|Okay. Understand; we're anticipating a normal SEP. If we get on the end of the probe and no release, we'll both thrust minus-X for 3 seconds.
04|04|04|39|CC|Roger. While you hold the switch in the RELEASE position. And we've got some other procedures that we'll run through in real time, if the requirement develops, in order to accomplish an undocking. We would like to say at this time, though, that we are not considering blowing the docking ring in order to undock. Over.
04|04|05|06|CMP|Okay. That sounds reasonable.
04|04|05|10|CC|And is A1 listening?
04|04|05|16|CMP|A1 is not on the headset right now, Bruce.
04|04|05|19|CC|Okay. I wonder if you'd pass to him that when he and Ed go over into the LM, they should either carry with them a tool R, that's tool Romeo, from the command module, or, if he should have such a thing as a screwdriver, bit, or something like that available, why that would also suffice. Over.
04|04|05|46|CMP|Okay. I'll let him borrow a tool R, I guess, on a hand receipt, and he'll take that over with him.
04|o4|05|54|CC|Roger. Be sure and get a QC stamp on it.
04|04|06|01|CMP|21 Nancy.
04|04|06|03|CC|(Laughter) Roger; 21 Nancy. Hey, a little more background on that - thing that we're looking for, of course, would be an item such as tool R that would enable our crewmen from the LM to depress the capture latch release button on the tip of the probe from the LM side, and tool R will fill this bill, or this other screwdriver, if it were available. Over.
04|04|06|32|CMP|Okay. We got you.
04|04|06|36|CC|And with respect to docking, again we anticipate normal operation. However, we'd like to add to the normal procedures a LM plus-X thrust of 10 seconds, four-jet RCS, to facilitate or to give us just a little more of a warm feeling on the docking. Once again, we have some backup procedures that we can run through in real time, if these should prove necessary, and, in order to formalize this, I've got a flight-plan update for the CMP Solo Book and for the LM Time Line Book whenever you all are ready to copy these down.
04|o4|07|28|CMP|Okay. Stand by here and let's get out the LM Time Line.
o4|o4|07|34|cc|Roger. I'll do likewise down here. And we'll make them together.
o4|o4|07|4l|CMP|Okay.
o4|o4|07|46|CC|And since you don't have a lot going on up there right now, Stu, I wondered if you could give us P00 and ACCEPT, and we'll send you up some uplinks We've got a state vector, a desired orientor REFSMMAT, a - and that's it.
04|04|08|04|CMP|Okay, You have P00 and ACCEPT.
04|04|08|15|CC|Okay, Stu. You seem to be fading out a little bit Are you close enough to the mike?
04|04|08|24|CMP|I - I'm talking right into them, Bruce. You have P00 and ACCEPT.
04|04|08|28|CC|Roger. Thank you. And would you return to the NARROW dead band five-tenths of a degree in the DAP, please?
04|04|08|38|CMP|Okay. Stand by 1.
04|04|08|4o|CC|That's in reference to keeping the HIGH GAIN pointed right at us here.
o4|04|08|46|CMP|Okay.
o4|04|09|43|CMP|Okay. I'm NARROW dead band. I'm through with the DSKY if you want to press with the uplink, and looks like we got good signal strength here.
04|04|09|50|CC|Okay. It looks real good here, Stu, and we'll press on with the uplink. And I got my Time Line Book out and we're going to page 14.
04|04|10|01|CMP|Okay. We'll have to stand by on that LM Time Line Book for a little bit here, Bruce.
04|04|10|05|CC|Okay.
04|04|10|15|CC|And back on the subject of the drogue, I guess our analysis down here and all the data that we've been able to come up with indicates that you did, in fact, have a normal retraction on the last attempt. The selection of a bottle did not contribute to the capture in itself, and we've passed you the procedures here that we'd like you to run through.
04|04|10|4l|CMP|Okay.
04|04|11|58|CMP|Houston, 14.
04|04|12|00|CC|Go ahead, 14.
04|04|12|06|CMP|Okay, Bruce. I - just something that seems like back from memory in debriefing from 11 - they tried this plus-X on the IM and docking and they got some - if I remember right - some attitude excursions. Is everybody satisfied that the LM can plus-X and everything will be stable?
04|04|12|51|CC|14, this is Houston. Roger. We recalled 11, and the biggest part of the problem there was that both vehicles were actively trying to control attitude. The procedure which we’ll be passing up to you has you going into CMC MODE, FREE, prior to the IM commencing its plus-X thrusting. Over.
04|04|13|19|CMP|Okay. So I guess we'll - we'll wait until we get the changes, and then we'll talk about it, if we've got any questions.
04|04|13|25|CC|Roger.
04|04|18|i4|CC|14, Houston. I have your CMC REFSMMAT zero time update for you. There is no GET or T , update . , i. ephem ^ required. Over.
04|04|18|31|CMP|Okay. And I'm ready to copy, Bruce.
04|04|18|34|CC|Okay, CMC REFSMMAT zero zero time is 108 hours 53 minutes 58.00 seconds. And I'll have the TEI-19 pad shortly. You want to go ahead and read back?
04|04|18|53|CMP|Okay, REFSMMAT zero zero time, 108 - 108?53:58.00.
04|04|19|01|CC|Roger, readback correct. I'll be coming at you with the TEI-19 pad in about 10 seconds.
04|04|19|09|CMP|Okay.
04|04|19|35|CC|And if you're ready to copy on TEI-19, I'm ready.
04|04|19|49|CMP|Okay, TEI-19; let her go, Bruce.
04|04|19|53|CC|Roger, Stu. SPS/G&N; 36583; minus 0.66, plus 0.24; T. , 119:38:09.13; NOUN 8l, plus 2903.4, plus 1564.7, minus 0485.2; roll, 179, 120, 029- The rest of the pad is NA. Ullage, four jets, 11 seconds. Remarks: this is an undocked burn. We assume circularization, but no plane change number 1. The lunar longitude that you are crossing at time of T. is minus 175-8 west longitude. Over, ig
04|04|21|23|CMP|Okay, TEI-19; SPS/G&N; 36583; minus 0.66, plus 0.24; 119:38:09.13; plus 2903.4, plus 1564.7, minus 0485.2; 179, 120, 029. Ullage, four jet, 11 seconds; undocked, assumed CIRC, no plane change 1; and longitude of Tig. minus 175.8.

o4|o4|22|14|CMP|Roger.
04|04|24|10|CMP|And, Houston, 14.
04|04|24|12|CC|Go ahead, Stu.
04|04|24|16|CMP|Okay, the IM/command module DELTA-P is 0.8.
04|04|24|22|CC|Houston, Roger. Out.
04|04|25|06|CC|Stu, Houston. How is your viewing attitude up there?
04|04|25|14|CMP|It's rather tremendous, Bruce. This - Coming across this low - low orbit is phenomenal, and this attitude is absolutely great.
o4|04|25|28|cc|I guess that settles that one.
04|04|26|03|CMP|I tell you one thing, Bruce; you sure get the impression you're more like about a thousand feet than 45,000.
04|04|26|13|CC|I guess the scenery is really clipping along.
04|04|26|19|CMP|Yes, and it seems so close. It looks like you can Just reach out and touch it.
o4|04|26|26|CC|The recent input from FA0 is that we need the Hycon camera check prior to a GET of 107 hours. That's about 6 hours from now.
o4|04|26|42|CMP|Okay, prior 107. And we'll sure try to give it a go.
04|o4|26|48|CC|Roger. And whenever you're ready on the flight-plan update to the CMP Solo Book and the IM Time Line Book, why, we've got it setting down here, but there's no rush.
04|o4|27|00|CMP|Okay, I can take the CMP Solo Book now, but we might as well get them both together, and it'11 be a little bit here. They're getting their suits on.
04|04|27|09|CC|Okay. Well, the details of the two are a little different.
04|o4|27|20|CMP|Okay, lets get me out of the way and take the Solo Book now.
o4|04|27|26|CC|Okay, on page 52.
o4|04|27|43|CMP|Okay, go ahe ad.
04|04|27|47|CC|"At 144 hours and 08 minutes, it presently reads, ""Translate to capture latch,"" we want to change that to read, ""Translate to contact."" Over."
04|04|28|11|CMP|"Okay, we'll change that ""Translate to contact,"" and hope they're both the same, huh?"
o4|o4|28|16|CC|"Roger, Roger. Under that, add in ""Report contacts to LM;"" and ""CMC MODE, FREE."" Over."
04|04|28|43|CMP|Okay/ and after contact, I'll report contact to IM and go CMC, FREE.
o4|04|28|49|CC|"Roger. And over there in the ""Docking checklist,"" we want to delete the ""CMC MODE, FREE."" It says, ""Docking checklist at capture, CMC MODE, FREE;"" you can delete that."
04|04|29|03|CMP|"Okay, I'll delete ""CMC MODE, FREE"" under the ""Docking checklist at capture."""
04|04|29|08|CC|And that's it. That wasn't so bad, was it?
04|04|29|13|CMP|No, that was pretty painless.
04|04|29|15|CC|21 Nancy.
04|04|29|19|CMP|Roger.
04|04|31|IT|CC|14, Houston.
04|04|31|23|CMP|Go ahead, Bruce.
04|04|31|24|CC|Yes, Stu; we just got word that your family is listening to you, and they're outside looking up at that great big Fra Mauro Moon.
04|04|31|36|CMP|Thank you.
04|04|31|57|CMP|Okay, Bruce; for their benefit - just to pinpoint us, we're approaching the terminator now and the Fra Mauro formation. And I guess of all the views you see, I think it's going to be tough to beat this - going into the terminator at this low altitude. It's - it's really something.
04|04|32|17|CC|It sounds really spectacular. I'm sure we'd all like to be up there with you. I know I would.
04|04|32|24|CMP|Yes, I wish you could be - yes, I wish you could be, after all that hard work.
04|04|32|54|CC|Apollo 14, this is Houston. We'd like to try the SECONDARY SERVO ELECTRONICS on the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA and attempt a normal acquisition. If that is unsuccessful, we'll return to the present configuration.
04|o4|33|13|CMP|All right, Bruce; go on SECONDARY, now.
04|04|33|29|CMP|Okay, how do you read, Bruce?
04|04|33|31|CC|Loud and clear, Stu. Looks beautiful.
04|04|33|36|CMP|Yes. I went SECONDARY, and there was not a glitch in - in anything.
04|04|33|42|CC|Are you in AUTO now?
04|04|33|47|CMP|Oh, no. I am - I'm sorry. I didn’t get the AUTO bit.
04|04|33|50|CC|Great.
04|04|33|51|CMP|I thought you Just wanted SECONDARY on the ELECTRONICS.
04|04|33|56|CC|Great. Now that you - -
04|04|33|58|CMP|You - you want AUTO MODE? Is that - -
04|04|34|00|CC|Now that you've got the SECONDARD SERVO ELECTRONICS up, we'd like you to run through a normal acquisition procedure; over.
04|04|34|10|CMP|Oh, okay.
04|04|35|07|CMP|14, Houston.
o4|o4|35|10|CC|Okay, loud and clear, Stu. It looks like it was successful. I understand - -
04|o4|35|16|CMP|That's negative. I’m back in MANUAL and MEDIUM. What happens when I go to AUTO - the PITCH goes to about a minus 50 and the YAW stays just about the same, but it seems like the AUTO MODE wants to drive the PITCH down to about minus 50; and if I do that in - in - in WIDE BEAM width and then I go to MEDIUM, NARROW, it doesn't seem to have any effect, and the signal strength drops back off.
o4|o4|35|51|CC|Okay, we copy, Stu.
04|04|35|56|CMP|And I'm back MANUAL, MEDIUM now.
04|04|36|00|CC|Roger. Out.
o4|o4|44|18|CC|Okay, Stu. We have your torquing angles. You're GO.
04|04|44|46|CMP|Okay, Bruce. Torqued at 101, 24, 20.
04|04|44|50|CC|101, 24, 20.
04|04|48|53|CC|14; Stu, this is Houston.
04|04|48|59|CMP|Go ahead.
04|04|49|01|CC|Roger, Stu. Prior to commencing your maneuver here, which it looks like you're about ready to do, we’ll give you an OMNI antenna to select. Once you get to the new attitude, we’d like you to return to MANUAL, MEDIUM BEAM width, and we'll give you PITCH and YAW angles. Over.
o4|04|49|19|CMP|All right, we're getting ready to manuever. Have you got the angles?
04|04|49|30|CC|Okay, Stuart. OMNI Bravo while maneuvering, and and the flight-plan angles of a PITCH, minus 80; and YAW, 98* are good.
o4|04|49|47|CMP|Okay, OMNI Bravo during the maneuver, and flight-plan angles good when we get there. Thank you.
o4|04|49|53|CC|Roger. And with respect to the LM Time Line Book, we'll try to pass this up in real time during the tail end of the rendezvous. You might pass to A1 that it essentially makes the Time Line Book agree with what we gave you in the CMP Solo Book -10 seconds or contact on the thrust X-plus at contact and then confirm docking. Confirm capture report from CSM.
04|04|50|21|CDR|Okay, Houston. We got that. And passing it up later is fine with us.
04|04|50|25|CC|Roger. We just wanted to make sure you were aware of what we had in mind.
04|04|51|16|cc|14, Houston. Six minutes to LOS.
04|04|51|21|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
04|04|56|33|CC|Apollo 14, this is Houston. One minute to LOS.
04|04|56|39|CDR|Roger, Houston.
04|04|56|42|LMP|Okay; 14 is up - on the time line, Houston.
04|04|56|47|CC|Say again?
04|04|56|55|CC|Okay, 14. Down here, we're going to turn over to the good old Gold Team, and the friendly Maroon Team will see you in a few hours.
04|04|57|06|LMP|Okay, stick around. We've got ice cream.
04|04|57|11|CDR|You'll be back for the fun, Bruce?
04|04|57|13|CC|I will; yes, indeed.

04|05|56|42|CC|Okay. I guess we've got the LM back now. Antares, Houston. Just want to verify you're in AUTO on the steerable.
04|05|56|51|LMP|That's affirm, Fredo. I went to AUTO, and it was holding at a signal strength of 3.9* and I looked back over and we're - suddenly we're at 3, and I tried to relock, and I can't get it above 3 except on the OMNI.
04|05|57|12|CC|Roger, Ed.
04|05|57|18|LMP|If you'll give me a new set of angles, we'll try it again.
04|05|57|21|CC|Stand by.
04|05|57|34|CC|Okay, Antares; Houston. We'd like you to try the steerable again, and the flight-plan angles are 116 and 4l. Should be good.
04|05|57|45|LMP|Okay. Here we go again.
o4|05|58|31|LMP|All right, Houston; Antares. I'm locked back up on the steerable, and that antenna's making a hell of a racket when it drives.
04|05|58|43|CC|Roger, Ed.
04|05|59|15|CC|And, Antares; Houston. We have good lock, now; and we'd like to verify you're in AUTO. And the noise - again, we're not knowing what level you're hearing; there is quite a bit of noise with that antenna.
04|05|59|31|LMP|I understand that. It's Just surprisingly much more than I expected, and I am in AUTO. And it seems to be holding at a signal, strength of about 3.9, ri ght now.
04|05|59|4i|CC|Okay. And, Antares, whenever you get time there to copy, I've got your AGS abort constants ready.
04|06|00|00|LMP|Okay. I'd like to hold those for a minute, Fredo.
04|06|00|03|CC|That would be fine, Ed.

o4|06|15|12|LMP|My S-band steerable pitch needle is sitting at 255 and will not move. The yaw seems to be working okay; however, I do not think that I'm in the stop.
04|06|15|33|CC|Okay. We copied, Antares. Your pitch reading is 255 5 and INC0 concurs that it appears down here you're not in the stop.
04|06|15|50|LMP|Okay, if you like, I took it out for safety's sake; I'll put it back on AUTO TRACK if you'll give me the angles again.
04|06|15|58|CC|Okay. Stand by,
04|06|16|06|CC|Okay. Antares, the numbers are plus 121 and 40 -plus 40 on the yaw.

04|06|42|26|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.
04|06|42|27|CC|Okay. With your meter problem there on the S-band, Ed, that you might change your LOS procedure to go on PITCH, 90; YAW, 0; and SLEW.
04|06|42|4l|LMP|Okay. I'll do that Fredo. And I just now noticed the meter is back with me again, but I suspect it’s not very reliable.
04|06|42|48|CC|Okay.
04|06|44|04|LMP|Houston. We had a PROGRAM alarm 1106 noted.
04|06|44|14|CC|Okay, Ed. We saw it here, and you can press on.
04|06|48|21|CMP|Okay, Al. Would you verify your hatch is closed and the DUMP VALVE, AUTO.
04|06|48|28|CDR|Verified.

04|07|39|58|CC|Kitty Hawk. Read you loud and clear.
04|07|4o|04|CMP|Okay. Like we're standing by for a GO for SEP.
04|07|40|12|CC|Roger, Kitty Hawk.
04|07|4l|03|CC|Antares, Houston. Are you online?
04|07|4l|12|CMP|Antares. Do you have lockup for Houston?
04|07|4l|15|LMP|Roger; stand by. Okay, Houston. You're locked up.
04|07|4i|26|CC|Roger, Antares. We would like HIGH BIT RATE.
o4|07|4i|33|LMP|And you have it.
04|07|43|15|CC|Antares, Houston. Could you try the SERVO again?
04|07|43|24|LMP|Houston. Let me put you on OMNI until we get undocked. I'm damn busy right now.
o4|07|43|32|CC|Okay, Ed.
04|07|43|35|CDR|Okay, Houston. Do you want the - I got the gimbal angles ready for you, if you're ready to copy.
04|07|43|46|CC|Okay. Go ahead.
04|07|43|52|CDR|Okay. On that drift check, I got a GET of 103:58:25; command module as follows: 007.69, 113.04, 022.88. Are you with me?

04|07|45|06|LMP|Okay.
04|07|45|07|CMP|Kitty Hawk; Roger.
04|07|45|09|CC|Okay. And I'd just like to reiterate some words I think you got passed from Bruce earlier. If the nominal undock does not take place after you get things damped out again, we need 5 seconds of minus-X thrusted by both vehicles. And Kitty Hawk should call the thrusting on and off.
04|07|45|37|CMP|Okay. You want 5 seconds. We were told 3 before, but - Okay, we want each one a minus 5 seconds while I'm holding the switch.
04|07|45|48|CC|That's affirmative, Stu. And you should call the on and off command.
04|07|45|55|CMP|Okay. I'm going to try the nominal first.
04|07|45|58|CC|That's affirmative.
04|07|46|15|CMP|Okay. Antares, how do you read on VOX?

04|07|50|11|CC|Roger, Antares.
o4|07|50|20|LMP-LM|I'll give you LOW bit rate, if you want it.
04|07|50|31|CC|Okay, Antares. You can stay in HI.
04|07|50|36|LMP-LM|Roger.
04|07|51|02|CMP|Okay, Al. You're around - you want me to verify your tracker light? And it's loud and clear.
04|07|51|19|CDR-LM|Okay, Stu. We have you and have the camera on, and you look mighty pretty out there.
04|07|51|24|CMP|Yes. I've been taking a few shots of you there. Pretty impressive. Okay, DAC going OFF.

04|07|53|11|LMP-LM|Roger. Stand by 1.
04|07|54|22|LMP-LM|Houston, Antares. I'd like to recheck those gimbal angles with you again, please.
04|07|54|28|CC|Okay. Go ahead, Antares.
04|07|54|34|LMP-LM|I'm little bit rushed here. Let me just give you the command module and LM angles again. Command module, 007.69, 113.04, 022.88; and’LM, I had 293.39, 293.05, 337.09.
04|07|55|01|CC|Okay, Antares. I copied command module: ' 007.69, 113.04, 022.88; LM: 293.39, 293.05, 337-09; and the GET was 103:58:25.
04|07|55|28|LMP-LM|That's correct, Fred. Thank you.
04|07|55|32|CDR-LM|Fred, I'm ready for the ... - REV 12 TCA.
04|07|55|51|CC|And, Antares; Houston. The TCA was 104:59:38. And we'd like to get the steerable again; PITCH, plus 66; YAW, minus 43.
04|07|56|23|LMP-LM|Okay, Fredo. You have the steerable again. Be advised, it seems to track for a few minutes, and then breaks lock, and then heads for the stop.
04|07|56|31|CC|Roger, Ed. The last loss there was due to a problem we had on the site on the ground here.
04|07|56|4l|LMP-LM|Okay.
04|07|56|47|CC|And, Antares, did you copy the TCA time?
04|07|56|53|CDR-LM|Roger. 104:59:38.

04|07|57|50|CC|Roger, Stu.
04|08|00|01|LMP-LM|Houston, Antares. We'll proceed with the DPS throttle check, if you're ready.
04|08|00|14|CC|Roger, Antares. That'll be all right, and, if you give us P00 and DATA, we'll pump you up a command module state vector.
04|08|00|25|LMP-LM|You have it, and we're proceeding with the throttle check.
04|08|00|29|CC|Roger.
04|08|00|53|LMP-LM|Okay. ENGINE STOP, push. We have a light.
04|08|01|11|LMP-LM|Okay, Houston'. Engine is armed, and we go with the Commander's MIN, soft stop; MAX; back to MIN. Here we go with the LMP. It's in MIN, soft stop; and going to MAX.
o4|08|02|11|CC|Antares, the throttle check looks good.
o4|08|02|16|LMP-LM|Okay; ARM, OFF.
o4|08|02|22|CC|Antares, Houston. The computer is yours.
o4|08|02|28|LMP-LM|Okay. Thank you.

04|08|03|ll|LMP-LM|Okay , thank you.
04|08|11|54|LMP-m|Houston, Antares.
04|08|11|58|CC|Go ahead, Antares.
04|08|12|03|LMP-LM|Roger. We're going over Hipparchus L and Hipparchus C at 8 minutes before the landing site. Looks just like the map.
04|08|12|13|CC|Roger, Ed.
04|08|12|56|CDR-LM|Okay. We got Albategnius on the left.
04|08|13|04|CC|Roger, A1.
o4|08|13|13|LMP-LM|We have Hipparchus J on the right as we're going over it. It looks like it's right below us, about 1000 feet. Instead of 40. This is Muller ahead of us, Muller A on the left, Muller 0 first. Hipparchus K out to the right.
04|08|13|37|CC|Look's like you're right on the line.
04|08|13|42|LMP-LM|Yes; we sure are.
04|08|13|53|LMP-LM|Fred, I don't see how we could clear that ridge ahead of us; it sticks up so far.
o4|08|14|12|CDR-LM|Okay, Ptolemaeus A on the left.
04|08|14|IT|cc|Roger, A1.
04|08|14|31|LMP-LM|We look like we're at about - about a foot above it, and Stu's below us. Here's Herschel out -Herschel out to the right.
04|08|15|54|LMP-IM|And the camera is started, Fredo, as we cross Lalande N and NA.
04|08|16|00|CC|Roger, Ed.
04|08|16|07|LMP-LM|Might even get a picture of Stu ahead of us; we're crossing Lalande C.
04|08|16|13|CC|Okay.
04|08|18|03|LMP-LM|Okay, Fredo. We're coming over Turner Crater. Looks just like on the map as we approach the site.
04|08|18|11|CC|Roger, Ed.
04|08|18|27|CC|Do you have about the same picture with respect to the shadows on those ridges up ahead, Ed, as the map?
04|08|18|36|LMP-LM|They don't seem quite as long as on the map, Fredo.
04|08|18|4i|CC|Okay.
04|08|20|27|CDR-LM|Okay, Houston. We've spotted the general area of the landing site from in this area on in. We didn't spot Cone Crater on this pass, however.
04|08|20|38|CC|Okay, Al. We'll get a look at it a couple passes lat er.
04|08|20|52|CDR-LM|And, Fredo, as we come up on Lansberg here, it's -the terminator is running right across it. And it was a big one. It really has some - a steep rim -or rather a high rim, very noticeably high rim from here - from here. And it’s right - the terminator goes right through it.
04|08|21|32|CC|And, Antares, Houston. You can use the same LOS procedures on the steerable.
04|08|21|4l|CDR-LM|Okay.
04|08|22|02|CMP|Okay, Houston. How do you read Kitty Hawk?
04|08|22|05|CC|Loud and clear, Kitty Hawk.
04|08|22|11|CMP|Okay, that pass went just as advertised. I think we've got plenty of marks on it.
04|08|22|18|CC|Very good, Stu.
04|08|22|58|CMP|Antares, Kitty Hawk.
04|08|23|00|LMP-LM|Go ahead.
04|08|23|01|CMP|Okay. I'm going to be setting up for ranging SIMPLEX B.
04|08|23|05|LMP-LM|Okay, we're right on the time line.
04|08|23|09|CMP|Okay.
04|08|23|33|CC|Kitty Hawk, Houston.
04|08|23|34|CMP|Say again, Ed. Go ahead, Houston.
04|08|23|39|CC|Roger, Kitty Hawk. We'd like to crank up the HIGH GAIN. PITCH, minus 87; YAW, plus 281; MANUAL and WIDE so we can get a tape dump.
04|08|23|53|CMP|Okay, minus 87, and say again the YAW?
04|08|23|57|CC|YAW, plus 281.
o4|08|24|02|CMP|281.
04|08|24|11|CMP|Okay. I read 0.53. No, make that 0.55; mine keep: varying a little bit.
04|08|25|34|LMP-LM|Okay, Stu. We'll take ...
04|08|25|44|CMP|Okay, I'm reading 0.57.

04|09|33|13|CC|Loud and clear.
04|09|33|19|CMP|Okay. The burn was on time. It was a G&N shutdown with a 2-foot-per-second overburn. I backed that off 1 foot by residuals after trimming for a minus 1.0, minus 0, plus 0.5. The attitude in which I trimmed was 353, 127, 005. CMC shows the orbit 63.9, 56.0.
04|09|34|35|CC|Okay; Kitty Hawk. The HIGH GAIN YAW is 197 and copied burn on time, G&N shutdown; NOUN 85 after trim were minus 1.0, minus 0, plus 0.5. And, you trimmed at attitude 353, 127, 005; and you ended up with a 63.9 by 56.0. And did you give a DELTA-V ? c
04|09|35|06|CMP|Roger. The DELTA-V^ was a minus 14.7 after - prior to trim. And, as I was cleaning up the main bus ties, it jumped around a little bit. And, after trim, it's reading a minus 12.8. It's really -doesn't figure too closely; I backed off 1 foot.

04|10|08|30|LMP-LM|That's correct.
04|10|13|10|CDR-LM|Okay, I have Cone Crater, Triplet, and Doublet. They all look just like they're supposed to.
04|10|13|17|CC|Very good, A1.
04|10|13|23|CDR-LM|And Star - Look right down there - right straight down - -
04|10|13|26|LMP-LM|Got them, yes, sure do.
04|10|13|31|CDR-LM|Yoo-ha! I think we’ll know it next time, Fredo.
04|10|13|33|CC|Very good.
04|10|13|38|IMP-LM|There they were right below us, big as life.
04|10|15|07|CDR-LM|Houston from Antares. The landing Sun angle looks very good for the next time around.
04|10|15|13|CC|Roger, Al.
o4|10|16|59|LMP-LM|Yes, sir. Fredo, the LNA really looks clear today
04|10|17|07|CC|Really does, huh?
04|10|17|27|LMP-LM|Fredo, I guess you'll advise us on that abort that - when we come round next time.
04|10|17|32|CC|Yes, I'm working up a little spiel right now, Al.
04|10|17|37|CDR-LM|Okay.
04|10|18|26|CMP|Okay, Fredo. Tracking on 14-1 went real well. I trust you got the data and ...
04|10|18|33|CC|Stand by 1.
04|10|19|52|CC|Antares , Houston. We'd like you to check the WATER SEP handle and make sure it's all the way in.
04|10|19|59|LMP-LM|Okay, Fred, I'll get to it in just a minute.
04|10|20|01|CC|Okay.
04|10|21|4l|CC|Kitty Hawk, Houston. OMNI Alfa.
04|10|22|21|LMP-LM|Houston, Antares. I verified that the WATER SEP handle is all the way in.
04|10|22|25|CC|Roger, Ed.
04|10|23|40|CC|Okay, Antares, Houston.
04|10|23|4T|LMP-LM|Go ahead.
04|10|23|48|CC|Okay, Ed. That bit just showed up again. Wonder if you could try tapping the panel there by the ABORT switch again.
04|10|23|59|LMP-LM|Okay.
04|10|24|20|LMP-LM|Anything yet, Fredo?
04|10|24|23|CC|Okay, Ed. You did good work again.
04|10|24|31|LMP-LM|Okay.
04|10|25|19|LMP-LM|Houston, Antares.
04|10|25|24|CC|Antares, Houston. Go ahead.
04|10|25|29|LMP-LM|Hello, Tom. Do you think we're going to come up with something on this problem with the ABORT button?
04|10|25|35|CC|Roger. We're working it right now and also MIT's working it. Needless to say, we're busy here, but we think we got a solution.
04|10|25|44|LMP-LM|Good enough. Something - is it something like a solder ball?
o4|10|25|48|CC|Well, we don't know yet. We got about 19 minutes until loss of signal here, so we'll have something to you before then, and we'll have some time to pick it up on the other side.
o4|10|25|58|LMP-LM|Thank you, Tom. ?
04|10|25|59|CC|Roger. Kitty Hawk, Houston.
04|10|26|08|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
04|10|26|09|CC|Roger. Got a map update, REV 14.
04|10|26|19|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.

04|10|26|38|CMP|Okay; 180, 107:49:38; LOS, 107:24:39-
04|10|26|44|CC|That's affirmative. And we have an LTC photo pad, 16. Roll, 000; pitch - -

04|10|27|20|CMP|Okay. LTC pad 16; 000, 303, 000; 108:37:36; 108:47:43; 91-4; 91-1- Sounds like they got the first team in down there.
04|10|27|38|CC|Yes. We got the original CAP COMM down here today. Okay. Let me give you an LTC pad for target 12, also.
04|10|27|49|CMP|Okay.
04|10|27|50|CC|Okay.
04|10|27|51|CMP|Stand by just 1.
o4|10|27|55|CC|Roll, 000 --
o4|10|27|56|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
04|10|27|58|CC|Roger. Roll, 000; pitch, 162.4; yaw, 000; T-start, 108:53:29; T-stop, 108:54:29; range, 94.1. Over.
04|10|28|26|CMP|Roger. 000; 108:53:29; 108:54:29; 94.1. And I've got a question on the Hycon. This morning Bruce started to give me some procedures they wanted me to troubleshoot with. He never finished, and we never got a chance to get back together again; and I think we ought to pick out a convenient time here and run over those. I've got the camera out, and, as I get a chance, I'll try to run through the procedures.
04|10|29|02|CC|Okay. We've got that down here in a stack we've got by - back to you momentarily on it. One correction on the range; it was 94.4.
o4|10|29|16|CMP|Okay. 94.4 - -
o4|10|29|18|CC|Roger.
o4|10|29|19|CMP|- - on LTC photo pad 12.
04|10|29|20|CC|Roger.
o4|10|29|32|CC|Kitty Hawk, Houston. I tell you we're going to keep the air clear with you most of the time until LOS so we can be talking to Antares. Over.
o4|10|29|43|CMP|Roger. I was thinking maybe if - can you bring up the other loop to talk to me on?
o4|10|29|50|CC|Yes. Okay. We're kind of busy here. We'll see about it.
o4|10|29|57|CMP|Okay. Whatever's customary.
o4|10|30|07|CC|Antares, Houston.
o4|10|30|13|LMP-LM|Go ahead.
04|10|30|14|CC|Okay, Ed, you and A1 ready to listen to some words on the abort bit business?
04|10|30|24|LMP-LM|Roger. We sure are. And did you get our torquing angles?
04|10|30|32|CC|That's affirm, Ed. Okay, Ed. And before I start in here, would you try tapping the panel again? The abort bit came back.
04|10|30|55|CC|Okay. You tapped it right again, Ed.
04|10|31|02|LMP-LM|Okay.
04|10|31|03|CC|Okay. I guess you've surmised already that we have some sort of a contamination in the ABORT switch. And the implications of that bit being set, I guess you also realize, means that in 63 we're going to find ourselves in P70.
04|10|31|27|CC|Okay, so - -
04|10|31|28|CDR|.. . , Fred.
04|10|31|30|CC|Say again, Ed. How do you read me now, Ed?
04|10|31|38|LMP-LM|That's affirm. We read you. Go ahead.
04|10|31|40|CC|Okay, Did you hear my last about the implications of that bit being set?
04|10|31|48|LMP-LM|That's affirm. We understand.
04|10|31|49|CC|Okay. So, directly, I'll be giving you some - -
04|10|31|52|CDR-LM|Affirmative.
04|10|31|53|CC|Roger, Al. I'll be giving you some changes to the time line here, whereby we'll be starting initiating PDI in PNGS, ATT HOLD, and MANUAL THROTTLE. The next consideration is if the bit sets during ullage, your procedure will be: STOP pushbutton to set and exit P63, or rather P70 in this case. And we'll have some further words on how you're to do that exit.
04|10|32|36|CDR-LM|Okay. We understand the strategy, I believe.
04|10|32|38|CC|Okay. Then we - we got some more. Assuming we -we get by ignition, like you to copy the following procedures.
04|10|32|54|CDR-LM|Stand by 1, Fred. And, while he's getting something to write on, I understand that you're going to be looking at the - you want us to be looking at the bit during the ullage cycle?
o4|10|33|12|CC|Negative, Al. You'll get the program switched to P70, which is your cue. We'll be - we'll be looking at it down here, too, to pass the word up.
04|10|33|26|CDR-LM|Okay. I misunderstood you. I understand. We just go to a regular 63. Okay.
04|10|33|29|CC|Okay. I just got corrected, Al. The switch to P70 would occur at ignition, at ignition.
o4|10|33|4o|CDR-LM|Okay. I understand.
04|10|33|42|LMP-LM|Okay, Fred. Do I have enough room to write just in the space on my PDI chart?
o4|10|33|47|CC|Stand by. Okay. You mean the time line, Ed, or your pad?
04|10|34|06|LMP-LM|The time line.
04|10|34|13|CC|All right, Ed - -
04|10|34|14|LMP-LM|... room on the DPS burn card, Fred. Go ahead with it.
04|10|34|17|CC|Okay. The procedure is VERB 25 NOUN 7 ENTER; 105 ENTER; 400 ENTER; 0 ENTER.
04|10|34|55|LMP-LM|Okay. I'll read back. VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER; 05 ENTER. Is it 4000 ENTER? 0 ENTER.
04|10|35|08|CC|Okay, Ed. It's - it's VERB 25 NOUN 7 ENTER. Then, 105 ENTER; 400, four zero zero, ENTER; 0 ENTER.
04|10|35|25|LMP-LM|Okay. VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER; 105 ENTER; 400 ENTER; 0 ENTER. And when do I do this?
04|10|35|34|CC|Okay. You can do this as soon as you can after ignition. We're trying to get this into - before there's any chance of the bit getting set in this interval.
04|10|35|49|LMP-LM|Okay. We have to let P63 call up normally, get ignition in ATT HOLD, MANUAL THROTTLE, and then reset the bit, hopefully, before it gets - or rather, lock out the bit, hopefully, before it gets set. Is that right?
04|10|36|03|CC|That's affirm, Ed. And, if somehow you get hung up a little further downstream, you can go ahead and throttle up manually at 26. I'd like to explain the implications of this. What we've done, then, is locked out P70 and P71, so any aborts have to be done on the AGS. And, while you got the card handle [sic] you can - I'll give you something that will reenable P70, P71.
04|10|36|36|LMP-LM|Okay. We understand, and go ahead with your work.
04|10|36|4i|CC|Okay. It's VERB 25 NOUN 7 ENTER; 105 ENTER; 400 ENTER; 1 ENTER.
04|10|36|57|LMP-LM|Okay. Readback: VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER; 105 ENTER; 400 ENTER; 1 ENTER. That's all straightforward enough.
04|10|37|06|CC|Okay, Ed. Once we're by that initial disabling step, we got it made. We'll comment that if, in the process of your keying that in, the abort bit sets, we'll be in P70; and, if that happens, we need the same as before ignition; we'll need to stop button set and exit the program, and we'll try it on the second pass.
04|10|37|36|LMP-LM|Okay. Are you going to give me the words on exiting now?
04|10|37|40|CC|Okay. They're still - they're still working on that - Right. And, Antares; Houston.
04|10|37|58|LMP-LM|Go ahead.
04|10|37|59|CC|Okay. Assuming we get through the disabling procedure, after that time you can go back to AUTO on the THROTTLE and the MODE CONTROL switch.
04|10|38|15|LMP-LM|Understand, Fredo. Thank you.
04|10|38|IT|CC|Okay. One other word. The same holds for any surface NO STAY. The abort there would have to be on AGS.
04|10|38|30|LMP-LM|Understand, Fred.
04|10|38|31|CC|Okay.
04|10|38|33|CDR-LM|Roger. We understand. Sounds like you all have been busy down there.
04|10|39|45|CC|Kitty Hawk, Houston.
04|10|39|54|CMP|» » »
04|10|39|56|CC|Stu, I have some more words on the topo camera that may help a little. We've got about 5 minutes left to - to get the - these in if you're ready to discuss it.
04|10|40|21|CMP|Okay, Gordon. Stand by just 1. Let me copy down my COAS CAL here.
04|10|40|25|CC|Okay.
04|10|40|32|CMP|It'll keep. Go ahead. Tell me what I ought to do.
o4|10|40|36|CC|Okay. By way of general discussion, evidently by recreating the noise here on the ground, the only way that we can recreate the noise is by causing a DC power current limit problem to the camera. An indication on board there that this is - that would really verify that it's a DC power problem would be a flickering power-on light while - while you're getting that clacking sound. But, any rate, the consensus here is that, when the camera is making the clacking sound, you're not getting good pictures. I believe you got the - about five steps about checking the panel 227 cable, and for pin damage, and reconnecting and switching the NONESSENTIAL BUS to MAIN A. Is that correct? Did you get those steps? Over.
04|10|4l|50|CMP|Gordon, you dropped out. Are you with me?
04|10|4l|53|CC|Roger, Stu. Where did I drop out?
04|10|4l|59|CMP|Okay. Both from you and Bruce, all I've got is to check the pins and the connections to see if things look all right and - and that's as far as I've gotten with either one - Oh, and to switch the NONESSENTIAL power to the other BUS.
04|10|42|16|cc|Okay. That's all we can do to try to improve the DC power problem. However, if you have time to verify that it's not a camera shutter being out of sequence - out of synchronization, you could shut the shutter to l/200th, and remove the magazine, and visually examine the shutter curtain inside to see that the slit in the shutter curtain is within 1 inch from one of the side rails, either side. And, at that time, examine the sprocket area from visible tears in the shutter curtain sprocket holes. After checking, if it is on one side, reinstall the magazine - and use magazine W for this - and actuate one single frame, and remove the magazine, and check that the slit is still positioned over to the side. If the slit is remaining in the center, then the camera shutter is completely out of SYNC and the camera is essentially unusable. Is that clear? Over.
04|10|43|42|CMP|Yes, I believe I've got that, Gordon. I'll put in magazine W, l/200th, and I guess fire a frame; remove the magazine, look at the slit, see if it’s an inch from the side rail; then I guess I’ll see some sprockets in there. And then if it is 1 inch, I’ll put the magazine back in, fire another frame, check that the slit is still there. If it's out in the center somewhere, well then, we've got big problems.
o4|10|44|10|CC|Okay. We're just about to LOS. If this looks okay, then prepare the camera according to the normal procedures. Set the mode switch to AUTO, and do not use standby position. Just start the camera by turning the power on while the switch is in AUTO.
o4|10|44|38|CC|And, Stu, one last thing. If the clacking starts, turn the power switch off and then back on, and that may stop it.
04|11|08|00||BEGIN LUNAR REV 14
04|11|28|14|cc|Antares, Houston.
04|11|28|19|CDR-IM|Go ahead, Houston.
04|11|28|23|CC|Okay. Read you loud and clear. And we got some more procedures to pump up that are going to alter what you already copied, and Ed might ought to get something a little bigger than the DPS card to write this down.
04|11|28|45|CDR-LM|Okay, stand by. Let's get locked up on the main load first.
04|11|28|48|CC|Okay.
04|11|29|08|CDR-IM|Now, in the meantime, do you still read me?
04|11|29|11|CC|Roger, Al.
04|11|29|16|CDR-IM|Okay, ASCENT BATs went on at 108:01:45.
04|11|29|24|CC|Roger. 108:01:45.
04|11|29|35|CDR-LM|And NOUN 93's as follows: plus 40, minus 52, minus 16.
04|11|29|45|CC|Okay. Copied plus 40, minus 52, and minus 16.
04|11|29|53|.CDR-LM|That's right. ..., 107:08:30.
04|11|30|00|CC|107:08:30.
04|11|30|12|CC|Okay, Antares; Houston. And, before we start here, the bit is set again; could you - You still there, Antares?
04|11|30|46|CDR-IM|Okay, I believe we're locked up now, Houston.
04|11|30|53|CC|Okay, Antares; Houston. If you get locked up there, you might just stay in SLEW.
04|11|31|04|CDR-LM|Okay, and we're locked up in AUTO TRACK, now.
04|11|31|08|CC|Okay. I don't know if you heard, the bit appeared to be set again, and we need you to rap on the panel again by the ABORT button.
04|ll|31|40|CC|Okay, Antares. The bit is reset. And, are you still reading now?
04|ll|31|50|CDR-LM|That's affirmative.
04|ll|31|51|CC|Okay, Al. The - the reason for the - some changes I'm ... to feed you up on the procedure is, we found, in the interim of time around the backside there, a little slicker way of doing this. And what it does is allows us to start PDI in the right configuration, switchvise. And, we can make an entry before we get to ullage or ignition that will get by that problem area.
o4|ll|32|2 6|CDR-LM|Sounds very good. Go ahead; we're ready.
o4|ll|32|36|CC|Okay. And in the interim here, Antares, could you give us P00 and DATA, so we could start getting the uplinks - in?
04|ll|32|44|CDR-LM|Okay. You have P00 and DATA.
04|ll|32|49|LMP-LM|And, Fred, I am having to stay on the OMNIs. I’m ... the S-BAND ANTENNA circuit breaker.
04|ll|32|55|CC|Okay, Ed. The first is after P63 selected and you're to NOUN 92, which, in the time line, is right up - correction NOUN 62 which is right after your ENTER at minus 4 minutes.
o4|ll|33|4i|CC|Okay, Antares. I've got a lot of static in the background here. How do you read?
04|ll|33|47|LMP-LM|Loud and clear. Keep going.
04|ll|33|49|CC|Okay. After the ENTER and check DET, Ed; we need a VERB 21 NOUN 01 ENTER; 10 10 ENTER; 107 ENTER.
04|ll|34|22|LMP-LM|Okay, Fred, I understand. After P63 is NOUN 9 -NOUN 62. At about 4 minutes, we want to ENTER VERB 21 NOUN 1; 101 ENTER; 107 ENTER.
04|ll|34|38|CC|Antares, Houston. Correction on your readback. It's VERB 21 NOUN 01 ENTER; 10 10 ENTER; 107 ENTER.
04|ll|34|54|LMP-LM|Roger; got you. 10 10 ENTER; 107 ENTER.
04|11|35|01|cc|Okay, that's correct. From there on, you can follow the nominal procedures through ignition. After ignition - -
04|11|35|13|LMP-LM|Okay.
04|11|35|16|CC|Okay. After ignition at plus 26 seconds on the -on page 6, we need MANUAL THROTTLE, up. And, so you don't misconstrue what I’m saying, we're - we had this AUTO switch in AUTO, but we're going to manually override it to FULL THROTTLE at 26 seconds.
04|11|35|39|IMP-LM|Okay. We understand that at ignition plus 26, we will MANUAL THROTTLE up, overriding the AUTO.
04|11|35|47|CC|That's correct. Okay. After we - after we get by THROTTLE UP, it's VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER; 101 ENTER; 200 ENTER; 01 ENTER. And this will enable guidance and give you steering at that time.
04|11|36|23|LMP-LM|Okay. Understand after THROTTLE up, we ENTER VERB 25 NOUN 7; 101 ENTER; 200 ENTER; 01 ENTER. And this enables guidance steering and - at that point.
04|11|36|4o|CC|Roger. Okay the next entry. VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER; 105 ENTER; 400 ENTER; 0 ENTER.
04|11|3T|07|LMP-LM|Okay. Understand VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER; 105 ENTER; 400 ENTER; 0 ENTER. And then it looks like our procedures you gave us earlier.
04|11|37|18|CC|That's right, Ed. This'll disable P70, P71. Okay, the next entry: VERB 21 NOUN 01 ENTER; 10 10 ENTER: 77 ENTER.
04|11|37|45|LMP-LM|Okay. VERB 21 NOUN 01 ENTER; 10 10 ENTER; 77 ENTER.
04|11|37|56|CC|Okay. This gets us in the P63 and the mode REG which is - gets us right for landing radar. Now, the same words apply if an abort requirement exists. We're going to be on the AGS. And one thing maybe I didn't make clear before, is the procedure for reenabling P70 - P71. You’re not to perform, unless you do abort on AGS.
04|11|38|35|LMP-LM|Roger. Roger. Understand that we will if - in the abort situation, we will abort on AGS and use the reenable procedure previously given up.
04|11|38|48|CC|Okay. And the only other thing I can say is, as you already know, be sure and get MANUAL THROTTLE up at 26; and after the last entry, Ed, add one more thing; we need THROTTLE to MINIMUM setting.
04|11|39|10|LMP-LM|Okay. Got that. The last entry we return to the COMMANDER'S THROTTLE to MINIMUM setting.
04|11|39|16|CC|That's affirm. Antares, Houston. We'd like FORWARD OMNI.
04|11|39|21|CDR-LM|Hey, let me just recheck one -
04|11|39|27|CDR-IM|Antares. You have FORWARD OMNI.
04|11|39|30|CC|Okay. I’m sorry I cut you out. Say again, Al.
03|11|39|35|CDR-LM|Let me just recheck one thing, now. With this new procedure; you want us to have the THROTTLE CONTROL in AUTO, MANUAL THROTTLE in COMMANDER'S. Even though we're going to make the override to full throttle at 26 seconds.
04|11|39|50|CC|That's affirm. And also the MODE CONTROL switch to PNGS in AUTO.
04|11|39|57|CDR-LM|All right, sir. Fine.
04|11|40|01|LMP-LM|Fredo, we need a few words on what you want to do with this S-band. I don't think you can fight it all the way down. Can we go with the OMNI?
04|11|4o|10|CC|Stand by, Ed.
04|11|40|24|LMP-LM|And, Fredo, one more question. Does this procedure, now, stay ... until such time as we get the dip aids [sic] the abort disable to feed in, or do we still need to rush right along to get that in?
04|11|40|39|CC|Ed, this procedure is good as long as we can get by the first entry with the bit not set. That is, the entry at - right after you get NOUN 62. If you get that in with the bit not set, we're in good shape.
04|11|40|58|LMP-LM|Okay. Is the bit not set now?
04|ll|4l|05|CC|That's affirm. The bit is not set now.
04|li|4i|11|LMP-LM|Okay. And I'm standing by to switch - OMNI antenna.
04|11|4l|40|CDR-LM|Houston, are you through with the computer?
04|11|4l|4T|CC|Antares, Houston. The computer's yours.
04|11|4i|52|CDR-LM|Okay.
04|11|42|13|LMP-LM|Houston, our VOICE BACKUP is giving us a hell of a squeal.
04|11|42|20|CC|Go ahead, Antares.
o4|11|42|25|LMP-LM|I say our VOICE BACKUP position of the UPDATA LINK switch is giving us quite a squeal. You ready for us to go to UPVOICE and BACKUP now?
04|11|42|37|CC|Okay. Stand by 1, Ed.
04|11|42|55|CC|Okay, Antares. They're configured. Now, you can try it one more time, Ed.

04|ll|43|34|CMP|
o4|ll|43|35|CC|Okay, you're way down in the mud, Stu. We're getting an awful lot of noise. We're going to drop the downlink - we're going to drop your downlink; and, if you call, call two times, so we can get it cranked back in here.
04|ll|43|51|CMP|Okay.
04|li|44|00|CC|And - Antares; Houston.
04|ll|44|06|LMP-LM|Go ahead.
04|ll|44|07|CC|Okay. And, since we dropped Kitty Hawk here, we're not going to be in that relay mode for this period; so, you probably won't get an answer from him, if you call him at 2 minutes.
04|ll|44|22|CDR-LM|Okay.
o4|ll|44|23|CC|Okay. I've got your downlink.
04|ll|44|25|CDR-LM|Okay. ... How do you read in VOX, Houston?

04|11|47|11|LMP-LM|Okay. We're a little ahead of time.
04|11|47|15|CDR-LM|Okay. I think, Houston, what we'll do just before we enter on the final trim is to call you to see if the bit is set at that time. Do you concur?
04|11|47|30|cc|Okay. It - it doesn't matter, Al. You can go ahead and make the enter and make the first entry at that time, after you get NOUN 62 up.
04|11|47|44|CDR-LM|Okay. But we seem to be fairly successful at resetting by tapping; so, if it shows prior to that time, then let us know.
04|11|47|51|CC|Okay.
04|11|48|02|LMP-LM|Then, let me read this. At 4 minutes, that goes in, ignition plus 26 MANUAL THROTTLE.
